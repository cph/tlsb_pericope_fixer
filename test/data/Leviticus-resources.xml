<h2 id="leviticus-article-reading-leviticus">Reading Leviticus</h2>
<p>He had pastured and watered the young bull all its days. Now the bull stood calmly before him as he solemnly placed his hands on its head. He nimbly swung a blade through the bottom of the animal&#8217;s throat, severing the main artery. Blood spurted and then drained rapidly into the bowls brought by the priests, who carried the blood to the altar while the worshiper continued to butcher and skin the animal. God would be honored by the fat, the kidneys, and the liver lobe that the priests would burn. The worshiper&#8217;s family would feast together on the meat the Lord had provided.</p>
<p>Leviticus opens with earthy, life-and-death detail about the sacrifices Israel was to offer at the tabernacle they had just built in the wilderness. Their cattle, which had traveled with them out of Egypt and southward to Sinai, would not only feed their eager bellies but also touch their hearts as living illustrations of God&#8217;s gracious provision for them. By these sacrifices, He would provide atonement for sin and food for life and fellowship in the congregation of Israel.</p>
<h2 id="leviticus-article-luther-on-leviticus">Luther on Leviticus</h2>
<p>The special topic of the third book [Leviticus] is the appointment of the priesthood, with the statutes and laws according to which the priests are to act and to teach the people. There we see that a priestly office is instituted only because of sin, to disclose sin to the people and to make atonement before God, so that its entire function is to deal with sin and sinners. For this reason too no temporal wealth is given to the priests; neither are they commanded or permitted to rule men&#8217;s bodies. Rather the only work assigned to them is to care for the people who are in sin. (<a class="bible" href="3035237-3035238" title="American Edition 35:237-38">AE 35:237&#8211;38</a>)</p>

<h2 id="leviticus-article-challenges-for-readers">Challenges for Readers</h2>
<p><em>Animal Sacrifice</em>. <a class="bible" href="3001007-3001007" title="chapters 1-7">Chs 1&#8211;7</a> provide detailed descriptions of animal sacrifice. The services God instituted for Israel are literally bathed in blood, which might be strange and offensive to many modern readers. However, in most cases the worshipers, or the priests and their families, ate the meat of the sacrifices in an experience comparable to congregational meals today. The Israelites did not have modern conveniences such as refrigeration; therefore, slaughter, cooking, and eating all took place together in a festive atmosphere of worship.</p>
<p><em>Goat Demons and Azazel</em>. Some modern commentators associate the atonement services of <a class="bible" href="3000016-3000016" title="chapter 16">ch 16</a> with sacrifices to &#8220;goat demons&#8221; (<a class="bible" href="3017007-3017007" title="Leviticus 17:7">17:7</a>), which they assume was a more primitive form of Israelite religion. There is no historical or textual basis for these assumptions. See note, <a class="bible" href="3016008-3016008" title="Leviticus 16:8">16:8</a>.</p>
<p><em>Nadab and Abihu Punished</em>. Moses did not fully describe the exact violation Aaron&#8217;s oldest sons committed, which resulted in God harshly punishing them. They mishandled an incense offering by using &#8220;unauthorized fire&#8221; (<a class="bible" href="3010001-3010001" title="Leviticus 10:1">10:1</a>), which could mean (1) they burned the incense that should have been sprinkled on the bread of the Presence, (2) they carried burning incense into the tabernacle when they were not supposed to, or (3) they used an unauthorized source for their fire. (Some commentators suggest these priests were drunk because a warning against using alcohol comes immediately after the incident [<a class="bible" href="3010009-3010009" title="Leviticus 10:9">10:9</a>].) God&#8217;s swift, harsh response seems surprising. As you read about such incidents, remember the weight of responsibility to which God calls leaders and teachers of the faith. His harshest punishments teach by example and set clear precedent in new situations (cf <a class="bible" href="2000032-2000032" title="Exodus 32">Ex 32</a>; <a class="bible" href="3024010-3024016" title="Leviticus 24:10-16">Lv 24:10&#8211;16</a>; <a class="bible" href="6000007-6000007" title="Joshua 7">Jsh 7</a>; <a class="bible" href="9006001-9006015" title="2 Samuel 6:1-15">2Sm 6:1&#8211;15</a>).</p>
<h2 id="leviticus-article-blessings-for-readers">Blessings for Readers</h2>
<p>As you study the Book of Leviticus, reflect on the detail and deep care with which God teaches the people about faithful, orderly worship. Though worship is chiefly a matter of faith and sincere repentance, God&#8217;s people must not regard the outward expressions of worship as mere formalism; our outward actions reveal our hearts. Genuine confession of faith manifests itself in thought, word, and deed.</p>
<p>Note especially the four greatest themes of Leviticus: cleansing, atonement, rest, and redemption. These themes foreshadow Jesus&#8217; sacrifice on the cross, His peace, and the freedom He grants us in the Gospel. Seeing these broad themes allows one to understand that Leviticus is truly about the chief article of the Christian faith: justification through Christ&#8217;s blood.</p>

<p><strong>1</strong></p>
<p><sup>a</sup>The <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> called Moses and spoke to him <sup>b</sup>from the tent of meeting, saying, <sup>2</sup>&#8220;Speak to the people of Israel and say to them, <sup>c</sup>When any one of you brings an offering to the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, you shall bring your offering of livestock from the herd or from the flock.</p>
<p><sup>3</sup>&#8220;If his <sup>d</sup>offering is a burnt offering from the herd, he shall offer <sup>e</sup>a male without blemish. He shall bring it to the entrance of the tent of meeting, that he may be accepted before the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>. <sup>4</sup><sup>f</sup>He shall lay his hand on the head of the burnt <sup>g</sup>offering, and it shall be <sup>h</sup>accepted for him <sup>i</sup>to make atonement for him. <sup>5</sup>Then he shall kill the bull before the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, and Aaron&#8217;s sons the priests shall bring the blood <sup>j</sup>and throw the blood against the sides of the altar that is at the entrance of the tent of meeting. <sup>6</sup>Then he shall flay the burnt offering and cut it into pieces, <sup>7</sup>and the sons of Aaron the priest shall put fire on the altar and <sup>k</sup>arrange wood on the fire. <sup>8</sup>And Aaron&#8217;s sons the priests shall arrange the pieces, the head, and the fat, on the wood that is on the fire on the altar; <sup>9</sup>but its entrails and its legs he shall wash with water. And the priest shall burn all of it on the altar, as <sup>l</sup>a burnt offering, a food offering<sup>1</sup> with a <sup>m</sup>pleasing aroma to the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>.</p>
<p><sup>10</sup>&#8220;If his gift for a burnt offering is from the flock, from the sheep or goats, he shall bring a male without blemish, <sup>11</sup><sup>n</sup>and he shall kill it on the north side of the altar before the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, and Aaron&#8217;s sons the priests shall throw its blood against the sides of the altar. <sup>12</sup>And he shall cut it into pieces, with its head and its fat, and the priest shall arrange them on the wood that is on the fire on the altar, <sup>13</sup>but the entrails and the legs he shall wash with water. And the priest shall offer all of it and burn it on the altar; it is <sup>l</sup>a burnt offering, a food offering with <sup>m</sup>a pleasing aroma to the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>.</p>
<p><sup>14</sup> &#8220;If his offering to the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> is a burnt offering of birds, then he shall bring his offering of <sup>o</sup>turtledoves or pigeons. <sup>15</sup>And the priest shall bring it to the altar and <sup>p</sup>wring off its head and burn it on the altar. Its blood shall be drained out on the side of the altar. <sup>16</sup>He shall remove its crop with its contents<sup>2</sup> and cast it <sup>q</sup>beside the altar on the east side, in the place for ashes. <sup>17</sup>He shall tear it open by its wings, but <sup>r</sup>shall not sever it completely. And the <sup>s</sup>priest shall burn it on the altar, on the wood that is on the fire. It is a burnt offering, a food offering with a pleasing aroma to the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>.</p>

<p><strong>2</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;When anyone brings a <sup>t</sup>grain offering as an offering to the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, his offering shall be of fine flour. <sup>u</sup>He shall pour oil on it and put frankincense on it <sup>2</sup>and bring it to Aaron&#8217;s sons the priests. And he shall take from it a handful of the fine flour and oil, with all of its frankincense, and the <sup>v</sup>priest shall burn this as its <sup>w</sup>memorial portion on the altar, a food <sup>x</sup>offering with a pleasing aroma to the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>. <sup>3</sup><sup>y</sup>But the <sup>z</sup>rest of the grain offering shall be for Aaron and his sons; <sup>a</sup>it is a most holy part of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>&#8217;s food offerings.</p>
<p><sup>4</sup>&#8220;When you bring a grain offering baked in the oven as an offering, it shall be <sup>b</sup>unleavened loaves of fine flour mixed with oil or unleavened wafers smeared with oil. <sup>5</sup>And if your offering is a grain offering <sup>c</sup>baked on a griddle, it shall be of fine flour unleavened, mixed with oil. <sup>6</sup>You shall break it in pieces and pour oil on it; it is a grain offering. <sup>7</sup>And if your offering is a grain offering cooked in a pan, it shall be made of fine flour with oil. <sup>8</sup>And you shall bring the grain offering that is made of these things to the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, and when it is presented to the priest, he shall bring it to the altar. <sup>9</sup>And the priest shall take from the grain <sup>d</sup>offering its memorial portion and burn this on the altar, a food <sup>e</sup>offering with a <sup>f</sup>pleasing aroma to the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>. <sup>10</sup>But the <sup>g</sup>rest of the grain offering shall be for Aaron and his sons; <sup>g</sup>it is a most holy part of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>&#8217;s food offerings.</p>
<p><sup>11</sup>&#8220;No grain offering that you bring to the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> shall be made with <sup>h</sup>leaven, for you shall burn no leaven nor any honey as a food offering to the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>. <sup>12</sup><sup>i</sup>As an offering of firstfruits you may bring them to the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, but they shall not be offered on the altar for a pleasing aroma. <sup>13</sup>You <sup>j</sup>shall season all your grain offerings with <sup>k</sup>salt.

<p>And the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> spoke to Moses, saying, <sup>2</sup>&#8220;Speak to the people of Israel, saying, <sup>g</sup>If anyone sins unintentionally<sup>1</sup> in any of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>&#8217;s commandments <sup>h</sup>about things not to be done, and does any one of them, <sup>3</sup>if it is the anointed priest who <sup>i</sup>sins, thus bringing guilt on the people, then he shall offer for the <sup>j</sup>sin that he has committed <sup>k</sup>a bull from the herd without blemish to the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> for a sin offering. <sup>4</sup>He shall bring the bull to the <sup>l</sup>entrance of the tent of meeting before the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> and lay his hand on the head of the bull and kill the bull before the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>. <sup>5</sup>And the anointed priest <sup>m</sup>shall take some of the blood of the bull and bring it into the tent of meeting, <sup>6</sup>and the priest shall dip his finger in the <sup>n</sup>blood and <sup>m</sup>sprinkle part of the blood seven times before the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> in front of the veil of the sanctuary. <sup>7</sup>And the priest <sup>o</sup>shall put some of the blood on the horns of the <sup>p</sup>altar of fragrant incense before the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> that is in the tent of meeting, and <sup>q</sup>all the rest of the blood of the bull he shall pour out at the base of the altar of burnt offering that is at the entrance of the <sup>r</sup>tent of meeting. <sup>8</sup>And all the fat of the bull of the sin offering he shall remove from it, <sup>s</sup>the fat that covers the entrails and all the fat that is on the entrails <sup>9</sup><sup>t</sup>and the two kidneys with the fat that is on them at the loins and the long lobe of the liver that he shall remove with the kidneys <sup>10</sup>(just as these are taken from the ox of the sacrifice of the peace offerings); and the priest shall burn them on the <sup>u</sup>altar of burnt offering. <sup>11</sup>But <sup>v</sup>the skin of the bull and all its flesh, with its head, its legs, its entrails, and its dung&#8212; <sup>12</sup>all the rest of the bull&#8212;he shall carry <sup>w</sup>outside the camp to a clean place, to the ash heap, and shall <sup>x</sup>burn it up on a fire of wood. On the ash heap it shall be burned up.</p>
<p><sup>13</sup><sup>y</sup>&#8220;If the whole congregation of Israel <sup>z</sup>sins unintentionally<sup>1</sup> and <sup>a</sup>the thing is hidden from the eyes of the assembly, and they do any one of the things that by the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>&#8217;s commandments ought not to be done, and they realize their guilt,<sup>2</sup> <sup>14</sup><sup>b</sup>when the sin which they have committed becomes known, the assembly shall offer a bull from the herd for a sin offering and bring it in front of the tent of meeting. <sup>15</sup>And the elders of the congregation <sup>c</sup>shall lay their hands on the head of the bull before the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, and the bull shall be killed before the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>. <sup>16</sup>Then <sup>d</sup>the anointed priest shall bring some of the <sup>e</sup>blood of the bull into the tent of meeting, <sup>17</sup>and the priest shall dip his finger in the <sup>f</sup>blood and sprinkle it seven times before the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> in front of the veil. <sup>18</sup>And he shall put some of the <sup>g</sup>blood on the horns of the altar that is in the tent of meeting before the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, and the rest of the blood he shall pour out at the base of the altar of burnt offering that is at the entrance of the tent of meeting. <sup>19</sup>And all its fat he shall take from it and burn on the altar. <sup>20</sup>Thus shall he do with the bull. As he did <sup>h</sup>with the bull of the sin offering, so shall he do with this. <sup>i</sup>And the priest shall make atonement for them, and they shall be forgiven. <sup>21</sup>And he shall carry the bull <sup>w</sup>outside the camp and burn it up as he burned the first bull; it is the sin offering for the <sup>j</sup>assembly.</p>
<p><sup>22</sup>&#8220;When a leader sins, <sup>k</sup>doing unintentionally any one of all the things that by the commandments of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> his God ought not to be done, and realizes his guilt, <sup>23</sup>or <sup>l</sup>the sin which he has committed is made known to him, he shall bring as his offering a goat, a male without blemish, <sup>24</sup>and <sup>m</sup>shall lay his hand on the head of the goat and kill it in the place where they kill the burnt offering before the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>; it is a sin offering. <sup>25</sup><sup>n</sup>Then the priest shall take some of the blood of the sin offering with his finger and put it on the horns of the altar of burnt offering and pour out the rest of its blood at the base of the altar of burnt offering. <sup>26</sup>And all its fat he shall burn on the altar, like <sup>o</sup>the fat of the sacrifice of peace offerings. So <sup>p</sup>the priest shall make atonement for him for his sin, and he shall be forgiven.</p>
<h2 id="leviticus-article-a-wrong-understanding-of-freedom">A Wrong Understanding of Freedom</h2>
<p>When the Law is minimized, God&#8217;s revelation in His Word is distorted. If the Law tells us the unchangeable will of God, then it follows that we should not&#8212;even if we could&#8212;discard the Law. To eliminate the Law is serious disservice to the very Word of God. But since the fall into sin in Eden, the perennial bent of humanity has been to do things that are openly repugnant to the will of the Creator. Man has become autonomous, a law unto himself, obeying no bounds&#8230;.</p>
<p>The claim of absolute freedom under the Gospel, apart from any ordering of life, is based on a false conception of the Gospel and a wrong understanding of freedom, which either sanctions disorder and anarchy or confuses Law and Gospel by assigning a normative function to the Gospel&#8230;. Once a church body begins to draw a wedge between the two doctrines, Law and Gospel, in a manner that subjects the Law to disdain and denigration, it is courting anarchy.</p>

<h2 id="leviticus-article-eating-the-offerings">Eating the Offerings</h2>
<p>Imagine the combination of a church, a slaughterhouse, and an open-air kitchen and you will begin to form a picture of the tabernacle. Each day, the priests sacrificed animals and grain offerings. On feast days, they made more extensive sacrifices based on the laws God gave Moses. When people brought their personal sacrifices to the Lord, the priests offered these as well.</p>
<p>The offerings we make today&#8212;bills and coins&#8212;may seem vastly different from the bloody sacrifices of the OT. However, in at least one way, our offerings and the offerings of the OT worked the same: both kinds of offerings have fed the Lord&#8217;s ministers and their families.</p>
<h3 id="leviticus-article-the-portion-of-the-priests-and-levites">The Portion of the Priests and Levites</h3>
<p>During the wilderness wanderings, the Lord commanded that the priests and Levites should receive a tithe of all the offerings in Israel (<a class="bible" href="4018008-4018032" title="Numbers 18:8-32">Nu 18:8&#8211;32</a>). The priests sacrificed a portion of this tithe by burning it or presenting it before the Holy Place of the tabernacle. The remainder of the meat or grain might feed the priests, the Levites, and their families.</p>
<p>When Israel settled in the Promised Land, the priests and Levites did not receive a major land grant like the other tribes. They made their living by teaching and guiding God&#8217;s people (cf <a class="bible" href="5017008-5017013" title="Deuteronomy 17:8-13">Dt 17:8&#8211;13</a>; <a class="bible" href="6000021-6000021" title="Joshua 21">Jsh 21</a>; <a class="bible" href="14015003-14015003" title="2 Chronicles 15:3">2Ch 15:3</a>; <a class="bible" href="3017007-3017009" title="Leviticus 17:7-9">17:7&#8211;9</a>). Leviticus provides the details about what portions of the sacrifices belonged to the priests. They did not eat any of the burnt offerings, but they were allowed to eat a portion of most other offerings. Here are examples (see also note, 2:3):</p>
<ul>
<li>Grain offering&#8212;<a class="bible" href="3002003-3002003,3002010-3002010" title="Leviticus 2:3; Leviticus 2:10">Lv 2:3, 10</a>; <a class="bible" href="3006016-3006016,3006018-3006018,3006023-3006023" title="Leviticus 6:16; Leviticus 6:18; Leviticus 6:23">6:16, 18, 23</a></li>
<li>Peace offering&#8212; <a class="bible" href="3007014-3007021,3000028-3000038" title="Leviticus 7:14-21; Leviticus 28-38">Lv 7:14&#8211;21, 28&#8211;38</a></li>
<li>Sin offering&#8212;<a class="bible" href="3006026-3006026,3006029-3006030" title="Leviticus 6:26; Leviticus 6:29-30">Lv 6:26, 29&#8211;30</a>;</li>
<li>Guilt offering&#8212;<a class="bible" href="3007006-3007010" title="Leviticus 7:6-10">Lv 7:6&#8211;10</a></li>
<li>Showbread&#8212;<a class="bible" href="3024009-3024009" title="Leviticus 24:9">Lv 24:9</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="leviticus-article-lost-priests-and-levites">Lost Priests and Levites</h3>
<p>When priests and Levites did not faithfully teach God&#8217;s Word, people stopped following the Law and bringing their offerings. As a consequence, the priests and Levites were forced to wander in search of other work. <a class="bible" href="7000017-7000019" title="Judges 17-19">Jgs 17&#8211;19</a> gives examples of two corrupt Levite priests wandering throughout the land. They join in idolatry, brutality, and other forms of wickedness. These stories illustrate the dreadful consequences of neglecting God&#8217;s Word.</p>
<p><a class="bible" href="9002012-9002017" title="1Samuel 2:12-17">1Sm 2:12&#8211;17</a> records an abuse of God&#8217;s offerings by Hophni and Phinehas, two sons of the high priest Eli. These young priests and their servants were consuming more and more of the offerings. They robbed their fellow Israelites and abused the sacrifices. As a result, God told the prophet Samuel that the sons of Eli would die. The entire family would lose its priestly office.</p>
<p>In 174 <span class="time">bc</span>, while the Seleucids of Syria ruled Jerusalem, there was a dispute between the priests. A priest named Jason obtained the high priesthood of Israel by offering the largest sum of money to the pagan Seleucid ruler Antiochus IV Epiphanes. Three years later, a man named Menelaus offered more money than Jason and received the high priesthood, even though Menelaus was not a descendant of Aaron. This unholy selling of the high priesthood led to the desecration of the temple and the Maccabean revolt (167 <span class="time">bc</span>). See pp 1553&#8211;58.</p>
<h3 id="leviticus-article-holy-offerings">Holy Offerings</h3>
<p>Each of these stories shows the seriousness of the call to administer God&#8217;s Word. They illustrate the need for faithfulness with the offerings of God&#8217;s people. Today, diligently pray for your pastor and other leaders in your congregation so that they will not enter temptation. As the Lord&#8217;s Word teaches, faithfully support His servants through your tithes and offerings. Remember that the Lord works through them and through you to accomplish His purposes.</p>
<p>As you make your offering to the Lord, remember what the Lord offered up for you&#8212;His only Son! Think of the constant blessings of body and soul the Lord bestows on you each day through Christ. Jesus made the perfect sacrifice once for all upon the cross. The Lord nourished the priests of the old covenant by the sacrifices, but today He nourishes the priesthood of believers through the sacrifice of Jesus, our Passover Lamb.</p>

<h2 id="leviticus-article-outmoded-or-relevant">Outmoded or Relevant?</h2>
<p>The demand for holiness did not end with the old covenant. Consider just a few passages from the new covenant:</p>
<p>Present your members as slaves to righteousness leading to sanctification. (<a class="bible" href="45006019-45006019" title="Romans 6:19">Rm 6:19</a>)</p>
<p>Present your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable to God. (<a class="bible" href="45012001-45012001" title="Romans 12:1">Rm 12:1</a>)</p>
<p>Let us cleanse ourselves from every defilement of body and spirit, bringing holiness to completion in the fear of God. (<a class="bible" href="46007001-46007001" title="2 Corinthians 7:1">2Co 7:1</a>)</p>
<p>We should be holy and blameless before Him. (<a class="bible" href="49001004-49001004" title="Ephesians 1:4">Eph 1:4</a>)</p>
<p>[He] called us to a holy calling, not because of our works but because of His own purpose and grace. (<a class="bible" href="54001009-54001009" title="2 Timothy 1:9">2Tm 1:9</a>)</p>
<p>As He who called you is holy, you also be holy in all your conduct. (<a class="bible" href="60001015-60001015" title="1 Peter 1:15">1Pt 1:15</a>)</p>
<p>In fact, were these passages (and many others from the New Testament) encountered in Leviticus, they would not be considered foreign elements.</p>
<p>Like Israel, the people of the new covenant must be holy in order to be in communion with God, and they must give evidence of that communion in holy worship and holy lives. Though many of the laws in Leviticus no longer apply (<a class="bible" href="48003019-48003019,48003025-48003025" title="Galatians 3:19-25">Gal 3:19&#8211;25</a>), the book (indeed, all the Law) still provides profitable instruction in holy living (<a class="bible" href="45007006-45007006" title="Romans 7:6">Rm 7:6</a>; <a class="bible" href="3012001-3012002" title="Leviticus 12:1-2">12:1&#8211;2</a>; <a class="bible" href="54003016-54003017" title="2 Timothy. 3:16-17">2Tm. 3:16&#8211;17</a>).</p>
<p>But since unholiness awaits God&#8217;s people at every corner of life, they (like Israel) must be <em>accounted</em> holy:</p>
<p>For in Him all the fullness of God was pleased to dwell, and through Him to reconcile to Himself all things,&#8230; making peace by the blood of His cross&#8230;. He has now reconciled [you] in His body of flesh by His death, in order to present you holy and blameless and above reproach before Him. (<a class="bible" href="51001019-51001023" title="Colossians 1:19-23">Col 1:19&#8211;23</a>)</p>
<p>This reconciliation is once and for all; every sin becomes contemporary with it and is atoned. The Lamb of God, slaughtered 20 centuries ago, gave benefit for sins committed today as well as for Israel&#8217;s sins long ago, for &#8220;it is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins&#8221; (<a class="bible" href="58010004-58010004" title="Hebrews 10:4">Heb 10:4</a>).</p>
<p>The sacrifices of the Old Testament have been abrogated because they pointed forward to the blood of Christ, who has come. Yet even the New Testament believer (who is, at the same time, a sinner with &#8220;natural&#8221; thinking) needs to read of them and hear again the underlying theology:</p>
<p>Sin is not a trivial matter. Every breaking of God&#8217;s will, including unwitting sin, has deadly consequences.</p>
<p>People can do nothing to make themselves acceptable to God. Their forfeited lives can be redeemed only by an atonement, a substitution, that God has &#8220;given on the altar.&#8221;</p>
<p>People daily need to seek the forgiving mercy of God.</p>
<p>Total redemption calls forth a total response and commitment to God. Holy living is living wholly to God. &#8220;You therefore must be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect&#8221; (<a class="bible" href="40005048-40005048" title="Matthew 5:48">Mt 5:48</a>).</p>
<p>Walter R. Roehrs, <em>Survey of Covenant History: A Historical Overview of the Old Testament</em> (St. Louis: Concordia, 1989), 63&#8211;64; Scripture quotations changed to <span class="time">esv</span>.</p>
<p><sup>27</sup>&#8220;If <sup>q</sup>anyone of the common people <sup>r</sup>sins unintentionally in doing any one of the things that by the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>&#8217;s commandments ought not to be done, and realizes his guilt, <sup>28</sup><sup>s</sup>or the sin which he has committed is made known to him, he shall bring for his offering a goat, a female without blemish, for his sin which he has committed. <sup>29</sup><sup>t</sup>And he shall lay his hand on the head of the sin offering and kill the sin offering in the place of burnt offering. <sup>30</sup>And the priest shall take some of its blood with his finger and put it on the horns of the altar of burnt offering and pour out all the rest of its blood at the base of the altar. <sup>31</sup>And <sup>u</sup>all its fat he shall remove, <sup>v</sup>as the fat is removed from the peace offerings, and the priest shall burn it on the altar for a <sup>w</sup>pleasing aroma to the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>. <sup>x</sup>And the priest shall make atonement for him, and he shall be forgiven.</p>
<p><sup>32</sup>&#8220;If he brings a lamb as his offering for a sin offering, he shall bring <sup>y</sup>a female without blemish <sup>33</sup><sup>t</sup>and lay his hand on the head of the sin offering and kill it for a sin offering in the place where they kill the burnt offering. <sup>34</sup>Then the priest shall take some of the blood of the sin offering with his finger and put it on the horns of the altar of burnt offering and pour out all the rest of its blood at the base of the altar. <sup>35</sup>And all its fat he shall remove <sup>z</sup>as the fat of the lamb is removed from the sacrifice of peace offerings, and the priest shall burn it on the altar, on top of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>&#8217;s food offerings. <sup>a</sup>And the priest shall make atonement for him for the sin which he has committed, and he shall be forgiven.</p>
<p><strong>5</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;If anyone sins in that he hears a public <sup>b</sup>adjuration to testify, and though he is a witness, whether he has seen or come to know the matter, yet does not speak, he shall <sup>c</sup>bear his iniquity; <sup>2</sup>or <sup>d</sup>if anyone touches an unclean thing, whether a carcass of an unclean wild animal or a carcass of unclean livestock or a carcass of unclean swarming things, and it is hidden from him and he has become unclean, and he realizes his guilt; <sup>3</sup>or if he touches <sup>e</sup>human uncleanness, of whatever sort the uncleanness may be with which one becomes unclean, and it is hidden from him, when he comes to know it, and realizes his guilt; <sup>4</sup>or if anyone utters with his lips a <sup>f</sup>rash oath to do evil or to do good, any sort of rash oath that people <sup>g</sup>swear, and it is hidden from him, when he comes to know it, and he realizes his guilt in any of these; <sup>5</sup>when he realizes his guilt in any of these and <sup>h</sup>confesses the sin he has committed, <sup>6</sup>he shall bring to the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> as his compensation<sup>1</sup> for the sin that he has committed, a female from the flock, a lamb or a goat, for a sin offering.

<p><sup>11</sup>&#8220;But if he cannot afford two turtledoves or two pigeons, then he shall bring as his <sup>p</sup>offering for the sin that he has committed a <sup>q</sup>tenth of an ephah<sup>1</sup> of fine flour for a sin offering.

<h2 id="leviticus-article-laws-for-guilt-offerings">Laws for Guilt Offerings</h2>
<p><sup>14</sup>The <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> spoke to Moses, saying, <sup>15</sup><sup>u</sup>&#8220;If anyone commits a breach of faith and <sup>v</sup>sins unintentionally in any of the holy things of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, <sup>w</sup>he shall bring to the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> as his compensation, a ram without blemish out of the flock, valued<sup>3</sup> in silver shekels,<sup>4</sup> according to the <sup>x</sup>shekel of the sanctuary, for a guilt offering. <sup>16</sup>He shall also make restitution for what he has done amiss in the holy thing and <sup>y</sup>shall add a fifth to it and give it to the priest. <sup>o</sup>And the priest shall make <sup>z</sup>atonement for him with the ram of the guilt offering, and he shall be forgiven.</p>

<p><strong>6</strong></p>
<p><sup>6</sup> The <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> spoke to Moses, saying, <sup>2</sup>&#8220;If anyone sins and <sup>d</sup>commits a breach of faith against the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> by <sup>e</sup>deceiving his neighbor in <sup>f</sup>a matter of deposit or security, or through robbery, or <sup>g</sup>if he has oppressed his neighbor <sup>3</sup>or <sup>h</sup>has found something lost and lied about it, <sup>i</sup>swearing falsely&#8212;in any of all the things that people do and sin thereby&#8212; <sup>4</sup>if he has <sup>j</sup>sinned and has realized his <sup>k</sup>guilt and will restore <sup>g</sup>what he took by robbery or what he got by oppression or the deposit that was committed to him or the lost thing that he found <sup>5</sup>or anything about which he has sworn falsely, he shall <sup>l</sup>restore it in full and shall add a fifth to it, and give it to him to whom it belongs on the day he realizes his guilt. <sup>6</sup>And he shall bring to the priest as his compensation to the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> <sup>m</sup>a ram without blemish out of the flock, or its equivalent for a guilt offering. <sup>7</sup><sup>n</sup>And the priest shall make atonement for him before the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, and he shall be forgiven for any of the things that one may do and thereby become guilty.&#8221;</p>
<h2 id="leviticus-article-the-priests-and-the-offerings">The Priests and the Offerings</h2>
<p><sup>8</sup><sup>7</sup> The <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> spoke to Moses, saying, <sup>9</sup>&#8220;Command Aaron and his sons, saying, This is the law of the burnt <sup>o</sup>offering. The burnt offering shall be on the hearth on the altar all night until the morning, and the fire of the altar shall be kept burning on it. <sup>10</sup>And <sup>p</sup>the priest shall put on his linen garment and put his linen undergarment on his body, and he shall take up the ashes to which the fire has reduced the burnt offering on the altar and put them <sup>q</sup>beside the altar. <sup>11</sup>Then <sup>r</sup>he shall take off his garments and put on other garments and carry the ashes <sup>s</sup>outside the camp to a clean place. <sup>12</sup>The fire on the altar shall be kept burning on it; it shall not go out. The priest shall burn wood on it every morning, and he shall arrange the burnt offering on it and shall burn on it <sup>t</sup>the fat of the peace offerings. <sup>13</sup>Fire shall be kept burning on the altar continually; it shall not go out.</p>
<p><sup>14</sup>&#8220;And this is the law of <sup>u</sup>the grain offering. The sons of Aaron shall offer it before the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> in front of the altar. <sup>15</sup>And one shall take from it a handful of the fine flour of the grain offering and its oil and all the frankincense that is on the grain offering and burn this as its <sup>v</sup>memorial portion on the altar, a pleasing aroma to the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>. <sup>16</sup>And <sup>w</sup>the rest of it Aaron and his sons shall eat. It shall be eaten <sup>x</sup>unleavened <sup>y</sup>in a holy place. In the court of the tent of meeting they shall eat it. <sup>17</sup><sup>z</sup>It shall not be baked with leaven. <sup>a</sup>I have given it as their portion of my food offerings. <sup>b</sup>It is a thing most holy, like the sin offering and the guilt offering. <sup>18</sup>Every <sup>c</sup>male among the children of Aaron may eat of it, as decreed forever throughout your <sup>d</sup>generations, from the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>&#8217;s food offerings. Whatever touches them shall become holy.&#8221;</p>
<p><sup>19</sup>The <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> spoke to Moses, saying, <sup>20</sup><sup>e</sup>&#8220;This is the offering that Aaron and his sons shall offer to the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> on the day when he is anointed: a <sup>f</sup>tenth of an ephah<sup>1</sup> of fine flour as a regular grain offering, half of it in the morning and half in the evening. <sup>21</sup>It shall be made with oil <sup>g</sup>on a griddle.

<p><sup>24</sup>The <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> spoke to Moses, saying, <sup>25</sup>&#8220;Speak to <sup>j</sup>Aaron and his sons, saying, <sup>k</sup>This is the law of the sin offering. <sup>l</sup>In the place where the burnt offering is killed shall the sin offering be killed before the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>; <sup>m</sup>it is most holy. <sup>26</sup><sup>n</sup>The priest who offers it for sin shall <sup>o</sup>eat it. <sup>p</sup>In a holy place it shall be eaten, in the court of the tent of meeting. <sup>27</sup>Whatever touches its flesh shall be holy, and when any of its blood is splashed on a garment, you shall wash that on which it was splashed in a holy place. <sup>28</sup>And <sup>q</sup>the earthenware vessel in which it is boiled <sup>r</sup>shall be broken.

<p><strong>7</strong></p>
<p><sup>u</sup>&#8220;This is the law of the <sup>v</sup>guilt offering. <sup>w</sup>It is most holy. <sup>2</sup><sup>x</sup>In the place where they kill the burnt <sup>y</sup>offering they shall kill the guilt offering, and its blood shall be thrown against the sides of the altar. <sup>3</sup>And <sup>z</sup>all its fat shall be offered, the fat tail, the fat that covers the entrails, <sup>4</sup>the two <sup>a</sup>kidneys with the fat that is on them at the loins, and the long lobe of the liver that he shall remove <sup>b</sup>with the kidneys. <sup>5</sup>The priest shall burn them on the altar as a food offering to the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>; it is a guilt offering. <sup>6</sup><sup>c</sup>Every male among the priests may eat of it. It shall be eaten in a holy place. <sup>d</sup>It is most holy. <sup>7</sup>The <sup>e</sup>guilt offering is just like the sin offering; there is one law for them. The priest who makes atonement with it shall have it. <sup>8</sup>And the priest who offers any man&#8217;s burnt offering shall have for himself the skin of the burnt offering that he has offered. <sup>9</sup>And <sup>f</sup>every grain offering baked <sup>g</sup>in the oven and all that is prepared <sup>h</sup>on a pan or a griddle shall belong to the priest who offers it. <sup>10</sup>And every grain offering, mixed with oil or dry, shall be shared equally among all the sons of Aaron.</p>
<p><sup>11</sup>&#8220;And this is the law of the <sup>i</sup>sacrifice of peace offerings that one may offer to the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>. <sup>12</sup>If he offers it for a <sup>j</sup>thanksgiving, then he shall offer with the thanksgiving sacrifice <sup>k</sup>unleavened loaves mixed with oil, unleavened wafers smeared with oil, and loaves of fine flour <sup>l</sup>well mixed with oil. <sup>13</sup><sup>m</sup>With the sacrifice of his peace offerings for thanksgiving he shall bring his offering with loaves of leavened bread. <sup>14</sup>And from it he shall offer one loaf from each offering, as a <sup>n</sup>gift to the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>. <sup>o</sup>It shall belong to the priest who throws the blood of the peace offerings. <sup>15</sup>And the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offerings <sup>p</sup>for thanksgiving shall be <sup>q</sup>eaten on the day of his offering. He shall not leave any of it until the morning. <sup>16</sup>But <sup>r</sup>if the sacrifice of his <sup>s</sup>offering is a vow offering or a freewill offering, it shall be eaten on the day that he offers his sacrifice, and on the next day what remains of it shall be eaten. <sup>17</sup>But what remains of the flesh of the sacrifice on the third day shall be burned up with fire. <sup>18</sup>If any of the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offering is eaten on the third day, he who offers it shall not be accepted, neither shall it be credited to him. It is <sup>t</sup>tainted, and he who eats of it shall bear his iniquity.</p>
<p><sup>19</sup>&#8220;Flesh that touches any unclean thing shall not be eaten. It shall be burned up with fire. All who are clean may eat flesh, <sup>20</sup>but the person who eats of the flesh of the sacrifice of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>&#8217;s peace offerings <sup>u</sup>while an uncleanness is on him, that person shall be cut off from his people. <sup>21</sup>And if anyone touches an unclean thing, whether <sup>v</sup>human uncleanness or an <sup>w</sup>unclean beast or any <sup>x</sup>unclean detestable creature, and then eats some flesh from the sacrifice of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>&#8217;s peace offerings, that person shall be cut off from his people.&#8221;</p>
<p><sup>22</sup>The <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> spoke to Moses, saying, <sup>23</sup>&#8220;Speak to the people of Israel, saying, <sup>y</sup>You shall eat no <sup>z</sup>fat, of ox or sheep or goat. <sup>24</sup>The fat of an animal <sup>a</sup>that dies of itself and the fat of one that is torn by beasts may be put to any other use, but on no account shall you eat it. <sup>25</sup>For every person who eats of the fat of an animal of which a food offering may be made to the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> shall be cut off from his people. <sup>26</sup>Moreover, <sup>b</sup>you shall eat no blood whatever, whether of fowl or of animal, in any of your dwelling places. <sup>27</sup>Whoever eats any blood, that person shall be cut off from his people.&#8221;</p>
<p><sup>28</sup>The <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> spoke to Moses, saying, <sup>29</sup>&#8220;Speak to the people of Israel, saying, <sup>c</sup>Whoever offers the sacrifice of his peace offerings to the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> shall bring his offering to the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> from the sacrifice of his peace offerings. <sup>30</sup><sup>d</sup>His own hands shall bring the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>&#8217;s food offerings.

It is a perpetual due throughout their generations.&#8221;</p>
<p><sup>37</sup>This is the law <sup>j</sup>of the burnt offering, of the grain offering, of the sin offering, <sup>k</sup>of the guilt offering, <sup>l</sup>of the ordination offering, and <sup>m</sup>of the peace offering, <sup>38</sup>which the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> commanded Moses on Mount Sinai, on the day that he commanded the people of Israel <sup>n</sup>to bring their <sup>o</sup>offerings to the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, in the wilderness of Sinai.</p>

<p><sup>p</sup>The <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> spoke to Moses, saying, <sup>2</sup>&#8220;Take Aaron and his sons with him, and <sup>q</sup>the garments and <sup>r</sup>the anointing oil and the bull of the sin offering and the two rams and the basket of unleavened bread. <sup>3</sup>And assemble all the congregation at the entrance of the tent of meeting.&#8221; <sup>4</sup>And Moses did as the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> commanded him, and the congregation was assembled at the entrance of the tent of meeting.</p>
<p><sup>5</sup>And Moses said to the congregation, <sup>s</sup>&#8220;This is the thing that the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> has commanded to be done.&#8221; <sup>6</sup>And Moses brought Aaron and his sons and washed them with water. <sup>7</sup>And he put <sup>t</sup>the coat on him and tied the sash around his waist and clothed him with the robe and put the ephod on him and tied the skillfully woven band of the ephod around him, binding it to him with the band.<sup>1</sup> <sup>8</sup>And he placed the breastpiece on him, and <sup>u</sup>in the breastpiece he put the Urim and the Thummim. <sup>9</sup>And he set <sup>t</sup>the turban on his head, and <sup>v</sup>on the turban, in front, he set the golden plate, the holy crown, as the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> commanded Moses.</p>
<p><sup>10</sup><sup>w</sup>Then Moses took the anointing oil and anointed the tabernacle and all that was in it, and consecrated them. <sup>11</sup>And he <sup>x</sup>sprinkled some of it on the altar seven times, and anointed the altar and all its utensils and the basin and its stand, to consecrate them. <sup>12</sup>And <sup>y</sup>he poured some of the anointing oil on Aaron&#8217;s head and anointed him to consecrate him. <sup>13</sup>And Moses brought Aaron&#8217;s sons and clothed them with coats and tied sashes around their waists and bound caps on them, as the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> commanded Moses.</p>
<p><sup>14</sup>Then he brought <sup>z</sup>the bull of the sin offering, and Aaron and his sons <sup>a</sup>laid their hands on the head of the bull of the sin offering. <sup>15</sup>And he<sup>2</sup> killed it, and <sup>b</sup>Moses took the blood, and with his finger put it on the horns of the altar around it and purified the altar and poured out the blood at the base of the altar and consecrated it to make atonement for it. <sup>16</sup><sup>c</sup>And he took all the fat that was on the entrails and the long lobe of the liver and the two kidneys with their fat, and Moses burned them on the altar. <sup>17</sup>But <sup>d</sup>the bull and its skin and its flesh and its dung he burned up with fire outside the camp, as the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> commanded Moses.</p>
<p><sup>18</sup><sup>e</sup>Then he presented the ram of the burnt offering, and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on the head of the ram. <sup>19</sup>And he killed it, and Moses threw the blood against the sides of the altar. <sup>20</sup>He cut the ram into pieces, and Moses <sup>f</sup>burned <sup>g</sup>the head and the pieces and the fat. <sup>21</sup>He washed the entrails and the legs with water, and Moses <sup>h</sup>burned the whole ram on the altar. It was a burnt offering with a pleasing aroma, a food offering for the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, as the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> commanded Moses.</p>
<p><sup>22</sup>Then <sup>i</sup>he presented the other <sup>j</sup>ram, the ram of ordination, and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on the head of the ram. <sup>23</sup>And he killed it, and Moses took some of its <sup>k</sup>blood and <sup>l</sup>put it on the lobe of Aaron&#8217;s right ear and on the thumb of his right hand and on the big toe of his right foot. <sup>24</sup>Then he presented Aaron&#8217;s sons, and Moses put some of the blood on the lobes of their right ears and on the thumbs of their right hands and on the big toes of their right feet. And Moses threw the blood against the sides of the altar. <sup>25</sup>Then he took the fat and the fat tail and all the fat that was on the entrails and the long lobe of the liver and the two kidneys with their fat and the right thigh, <sup>26</sup>and out of the basket of unleavened bread that was before the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> he took one unleavened loaf and one loaf of bread with oil and one wafer and placed them on the pieces of fat and on the right thigh. <sup>27</sup>And he put all these in the <sup>m</sup>hands of Aaron and in the hands of his sons and waved them as a wave offering before the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>. <sup>28</sup>Then Moses took them from their hands and burned them on the altar with the burnt <sup>n</sup>offering. This was an ordination offering with a pleasing aroma, a food offering to the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>. <sup>29</sup>And Moses took the <sup>o</sup>breast and waved it for a wave offering before the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>. It was Moses&#8217; portion of the ram of ordination, as the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> commanded Moses.</p>
<p><sup>30</sup>Then <sup>p</sup>Moses took some of the anointing oil and of the blood that was on the altar and sprinkled it on Aaron and his garments, and also on his sons and his sons&#8217; garments.

<p><sup>31</sup>And Moses said to Aaron and his sons, &#8220;Boil the <sup>q</sup>flesh at the entrance of the tent of meeting, and there eat it and the <sup>r</sup>bread that is in the basket of ordination offerings, as I commanded, saying, &#8216;Aaron and his sons shall eat it.&#8217; <sup>32</sup>And what remains of the flesh and the bread you shall burn up with fire. <sup>33</sup>And you shall not go outside the entrance of the tent of meeting for seven days, until the days of your <sup>s</sup>ordination are completed, for it <sup>t</sup>will take seven days to ordain you. <sup>34</sup>As has been done today, the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> has commanded to be done to make atonement for you. <sup>35</sup>At the entrance of the tent of meeting you shall remain day and night for seven days, performing what the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> has <sup>u</sup>charged, so that you do not die, for so I have been commanded.&#8221; <sup>36</sup>And Aaron and his sons did all the things that the <sup>v</sup><span class="divine-name">Lord</span> commanded by Moses.</p>

<p><strong>9</strong></p>
<p><sup>w</sup>On the eighth day <sup>x</sup>Moses called Aaron and his sons and the elders of Israel, <sup>2</sup>and he said to Aaron, <sup>y</sup>&#8220;Take for yourself a bull calf for a sin offering and <sup>z</sup>a ram for a burnt offering, both without blemish, and offer them before the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>. <sup>3</sup>And say to the people of Israel, <sup>a</sup>&#8216;Take a male goat for a sin offering, and a calf and a lamb, both a year old without blemish, for a burnt offering, <sup>4</sup>and an ox and a ram for peace offerings, to sacrifice before the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, and <sup>b</sup>a grain offering mixed with oil, for <sup>c</sup>today the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> will appear to you.&#8217;&#8221; <sup>5</sup>And they brought what Moses commanded in front of the tent of meeting, and all the congregation drew near and stood before the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>. <sup>6</sup>And Moses said, &#8220;This is the thing that the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> commanded you to do, that the glory of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> may appear to you.&#8221; <sup>7</sup>Then Moses said to Aaron, &#8220;Draw near to the altar and <sup>d</sup>offer your sin offering and your burnt offering and <sup>e</sup>make atonement for yourself and for the people, and bring the offering of the people and make atonement for them, as the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> has commanded.&#8221;</p>
<p><sup>8</sup>So Aaron drew near to the altar and killed the calf of the sin offering, which was for himself. <sup>9</sup><sup>f</sup>And the sons of Aaron presented the blood to him, and he dipped his finger in the blood and <sup>g</sup>put it on the horns of the altar and poured out the blood at the base of the altar. <sup>10</sup><sup>h</sup>But the <sup>i</sup>fat and the kidneys and the long lobe of the liver from the sin offering he burned on the altar, <sup>j</sup>as the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> commanded Moses. <sup>11</sup><sup>k</sup>The flesh and the skin he burned up with fire outside the camp.</p>
<p><sup>12</sup>Then he killed the burnt offering, and Aaron&#8217;s sons handed him the blood, and he <sup>l</sup>threw it against the sides of the altar. <sup>13</sup><sup>m</sup>And they handed the burnt offering to him, piece by piece, and the head, and he burned them on the altar. <sup>14</sup><sup>n</sup>And he washed the entrails and the legs and burned them with the burnt offering on the altar.</p>
<p><sup>15</sup><sup>o</sup>Then he presented the people&#8217;s offering and took the goat of the sin offering that was for the people and killed it and <sup>p</sup>offered it as a sin offering, <sup>q</sup>like the first one. <sup>16</sup>And he presented the burnt offering and offered it <sup>r</sup>according to the <sup>s</sup>rule. <sup>17</sup>And he presented the <sup>t</sup>grain offering, took a handful of it, and burned it on the altar, <sup>u</sup>besides the burnt offering of the morning.</p>
<p><sup>18</sup>Then he killed the ox and the ram, <sup>v</sup>the sacrifice of peace offerings for the people.

<p><sup>22</sup>Then Aaron <sup>a</sup>lifted up his hands toward the people and <sup>b</sup>blessed them, and he came down from offering the sin offering and the burnt offering and the peace offerings. <sup>23</sup>And Moses and Aaron went into the tent of meeting, and when they came out they blessed the people, and <sup>c</sup>the glory of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> appeared to all the people. <sup>24</sup>And <sup>d</sup>fire came out from before the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> and consumed the burnt offering and the pieces of fat on the altar, and when all the people saw it, <sup>e</sup>they shouted and <sup>f</sup>fell on their faces.</p>

<p><sup>4</sup>And Moses called Mishael and Elzaphan, the sons of <sup>n</sup>Uzziel the uncle of Aaron, and said to them, &#8220;Come near; carry your brothers away from the front of the sanctuary and out of the camp.&#8221; <sup>5</sup>So they came near and <sup>o</sup>carried them in their coats out of the camp, as Moses had said. <sup>6</sup>And Moses said to Aaron and to Eleazar and Ithamar his sons, <sup>p</sup>&#8220;Do not let the hair of your heads hang loose, and do not tear your clothes, lest you die, and <sup>q</sup>wrath come upon all the congregation; but let your brothers, the whole house of Israel, bewail the burning that the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> has kindled. <sup>7</sup><sup>r</sup>And do not go outside the entrance of the tent of meeting, lest you die, <sup>s</sup>for the anointing oil of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> is upon you.&#8221; And they did according to the word of Moses.</p>
<p><sup>8</sup>And the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> spoke to Aaron, saying, <sup>9</sup><sup>t</sup>&#8220;Drink no wine or strong drink, you or your sons with you, when you go into the tent of meeting, lest you die.

<p><sup>12</sup> Moses spoke to Aaron and to Eleazar and Ithamar, his surviving sons: &#8220;Take the <sup>x</sup>grain offering that is left of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>&#8217;s food offerings, and eat it unleavened beside the altar, for <sup>y</sup>it is most holy. <sup>13</sup>You shall eat it in a holy place, because it is your due and your sons&#8217; due, from the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>&#8217;s food offerings, for <sup>z</sup>so I am commanded. <sup>14</sup>But the <sup>a</sup>breast that is waved and the thigh that is contributed you shall eat in a clean place, you and your sons and your daughters with you, for they are given as your due and your sons&#8217; due from the sacrifices of the peace offerings of the people of Israel. <sup>15</sup><sup>b</sup>The thigh that is contributed and the breast that is waved they shall bring with the food offerings of the fat pieces to wave for a wave offering before the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, and it shall be yours and your sons&#8217; with you as a due forever, as the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> has commanded.&#8221;</p>
<p><sup>16</sup>Now Moses diligently inquired about <sup>c</sup>the goat of the sin offering, and behold, it was burned up! And he was angry with Eleazar and Ithamar, the surviving sons of Aaron, saying, <sup>17</sup><sup>d</sup>&#8220;Why have you not eaten the <sup>e</sup>sin offering in the place of the sanctuary, since <sup>y</sup>it is a thing most holy and has been given to you that you may bear the iniquity of the congregation, to make atonement for them before the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>? <sup>18</sup>Behold, <sup>f</sup>its blood was not brought into the inner part of the sanctuary. You certainly ought to have eaten it in the sanctuary, <sup>g</sup>as I commanded.&#8221; <sup>19</sup>And Aaron said to Moses, &#8220;Behold, <sup>h</sup>today they have offered their sin offering and their burnt offering before the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, and yet such things as these have happened to me! If I had eaten the sin offering today, <sup>i</sup>would the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> have approved?&#8221; <sup>20</sup>And when Moses heard that, he <sup>j</sup>approved.</p>

<p>And the <sup>k</sup><span class="divine-name">Lord</span> spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying to them, <sup>2</sup>&#8220;Speak to the people of Israel, saying, <sup>l</sup>These are the living things that you may eat among all the animals that are on the earth. <sup>3</sup>Whatever parts the hoof and is cloven-footed and chews the cud, among the animals, you may eat. <sup>4</sup>Nevertheless, among those that chew the cud or part the hoof, you shall not eat these: The camel, because it chews the cud but does not part the hoof, is unclean to you. <sup>5</sup>And the <sup>m</sup>rock badger, because it chews the cud but does not part the hoof, is unclean to you. <sup>6</sup>And the hare, because it chews the cud but does not part the hoof, is unclean to you. <sup>7</sup>And the pig, because it parts the hoof and is cloven-footed but does not chew the cud, <sup>n</sup>is unclean to you. <sup>8</sup>You shall not eat any of their flesh, and you shall not touch their carcasses; they are unclean to you.</p>
<p><sup>9</sup>&#8220;These you may eat, of all that are in the waters. Everything in the waters that has fins and scales, whether in the seas or in the rivers, you may eat. <sup>10</sup>But anything in the seas or the rivers that has not fins and scales, of the swarming creatures in the waters and of the living creatures that are in the waters, is <sup>o</sup>detestable to you. <sup>11</sup>You shall regard them as detestable; you shall not eat any of their flesh, and you shall detest their carcasses. <sup>12</sup>Everything in the waters that has not fins and scales is detestable to you.</p>
<p><sup>13</sup>&#8220;And these you shall detest among the birds;<sup>1</sup> they shall not be eaten; they are <sup>o</sup>detestable: <sup>p</sup>the eagle,<sup>2</sup> the bearded vulture, the black vulture, <sup>14</sup>the kite, <sup>q</sup>the falcon of any kind, <sup>15</sup>every raven of any kind, <sup>16</sup>the ostrich, the nighthawk, the sea gull, the <sup>r</sup>hawk of any kind, <sup>17</sup>the <sup>s</sup>little owl, the cormorant, the <sup>t</sup>short-eared owl, <sup>18</sup>the barn owl, the <sup>u</sup>tawny owl, the carrion vulture, <sup>19</sup>the stork, the heron of any kind, the hoopoe, and <sup>v</sup>the bat.</p>
<p><sup>20</sup>&#8220;All winged insects that go on all fours are detestable to you. <sup>21</sup>Yet among the winged insects that go on all fours you may eat those that have jointed legs above their feet, with which to hop on the ground. <sup>22</sup>Of them you may eat: <sup>w</sup>the locust of any kind, the bald locust of any kind, the cricket of any kind, and the grasshopper of any kind. <sup>23</sup>But all other winged insects that have four feet are detestable to you.</p>
<p><sup>24</sup>&#8220;And by these you shall become <sup>x</sup>unclean. Whoever touches their carcass shall be unclean until the evening, <sup>25</sup>and whoever carries any part of their carcass <sup>y</sup>shall wash his clothes and be unclean until the evening. <sup>26</sup>Every animal that parts the hoof but is not cloven-footed or does not chew the cud is unclean to you. Everyone who touches them shall be unclean. <sup>27</sup>And all that walk on their paws, among the animals that go on all fours, are unclean to you. Whoever touches their carcass shall be unclean until the evening, <sup>28</sup>and he who carries their carcass <sup>y</sup>shall wash his clothes and be unclean until the evening; they are unclean to you.</p>
<p><sup>29</sup>&#8220;And these are unclean to you among the swarming things that swarm on the ground: the mole rat, <sup>z</sup>the mouse, the great lizard of any kind, <sup>30</sup>the gecko, the monitor lizard, the lizard, the sand lizard, and the chameleon. <sup>31</sup>These are unclean to you among all that swarm. Whoever touches them when they are dead shall be unclean until the evening. <sup>32</sup>And anything on which any of them falls when they are dead shall be unclean, whether it is an article of wood or a garment or a skin or a sack, any article that is used for any purpose. <sup>a</sup>It must be put into water, and it shall be unclean until the evening; then it shall be clean. <sup>33</sup>And if any of them falls into any earthenware vessel, all that is in it shall be unclean, and you <sup>b</sup>shall break it. <sup>34</sup>Any food in it that could be eaten, on which water comes, shall be unclean. And all drink that could be drunk from every such vessel shall be unclean. <sup>35</sup>And everything on which any part of their carcass falls shall be unclean. Whether oven or stove, it shall be broken in pieces. They are unclean and shall remain unclean for you. <sup>36</sup>Nevertheless, a spring or a cistern holding water shall be clean, but whoever touches a <sup>c</sup>carcass in them shall be unclean. <sup>37</sup>And if any part of their carcass falls upon any seed grain that is to be sown, it is clean, <sup>38</sup>but if water is put on the seed and any part of their carcass falls on it, it is unclean to you.</p>
<p><sup>39</sup>&#8220;And if any animal which you may eat dies, whoever touches its carcass shall be unclean until the evening, <sup>40</sup>and <sup>d</sup>whoever eats of its carcass shall wash his clothes and be unclean until the evening.

<p><sup>41</sup><sup>e</sup>&#8220;Every swarming thing that swarms on the ground is detestable; it shall not be eaten. <sup>42</sup>Whatever goes on its belly, and whatever goes on all fours, or whatever has many feet, any swarming thing that swarms on the ground, you shall not eat, for they are detestable. <sup>43</sup><sup>f</sup>You shall not make yourselves detestable with any swarming thing that swarms, and you shall not defile yourselves with them, and become unclean through them. <sup>44</sup>For I am the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> your God.

<p><sup>46</sup>This is the law about beast and bird and every living creature that moves through the waters and every creature that swarms on the ground, <sup>47</sup><sup>i</sup>to make a distinction between the unclean and the clean and between the living creature that may be eaten and the living creature that may not be eaten.</p>
<h2 id="leviticus-article-purification-after-childbirth">Purification After Childbirth</h2>

<p>The <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> spoke to Moses, saying, <sup>2</sup>&#8220;Speak to the people of Israel, saying, &#8216;If a woman conceives and bears a male child, then <sup>j</sup>she shall be unclean seven days. <sup>k</sup>As at the time of her menstruation, she shall be unclean. <sup>3</sup>And on the <sup>l</sup>eighth day the flesh of his foreskin shall be circumcised. <sup>4</sup>Then she shall continue for thirty-three days in the blood of her purifying.

Then she shall be clean from the flow of her blood. This is the law for her who bears a child, either male or female. <sup>8</sup>And if she cannot afford a lamb, then she shall take <sup>n</sup>two turtledoves or two pigeons,<sup>1</sup> <sup>o</sup>one for a burnt offering and the other for a sin offering. <sup>p</sup>And the priest shall make atonement for her, and she shall be clean.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<h2 id="leviticus-article-laws-about-leprosy">Laws About Leprosy</h2>
<p><strong>13</strong></p>
<p>The <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying, <sup>2</sup>&#8220;When a person has on the skin of his body a <sup>q</sup>swelling or an eruption or a spot, and it turns into a case of <sup>r</sup>leprous<sup>1</sup> disease on the skin of his body, <sup>s</sup>then he shall be brought to Aaron the priest or to one of his sons the priests, <sup>3</sup>and the priest shall <sup>t</sup>examine the diseased area on the skin of his body. And if the hair in the diseased area has turned white and the disease appears to be deeper than the skin of his body, it is a case of leprous disease. When the priest has examined him, he shall pronounce him unclean. <sup>4</sup>But if the spot is white in the skin of his body and appears no deeper than the skin, and the hair in it has not turned white, <sup>u</sup>the priest shall shut up the diseased person for seven days. <sup>5</sup>And the priest shall examine him on the seventh day, and if in his eyes the disease is checked and the disease has not spread in the skin, then the <sup>u</sup>priest shall shut him up for another seven days. <sup>6</sup>And the priest shall examine him again on the seventh day, and if the diseased area has faded and the disease has not spread in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him <sup>v</sup>clean; it is only an eruption. And <sup>w</sup>he shall wash his clothes and be clean. <sup>7</sup>But if the eruption spreads in the skin, after he has shown himself to the priest for his cleansing, he shall appear again before the priest. <sup>8</sup>And the priest shall look, and if the eruption has <sup>x</sup>spread in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean; it is a leprous disease.</p>
<p><sup>9</sup>&#8220;When a man is afflicted with a leprous disease, he shall be brought to the priest, <sup>10</sup>and the priest shall look. And if there is a <sup>y</sup>white swelling in the skin that has turned the hair white, and there is raw flesh in the swelling, <sup>11</sup>it is a chronic leprous disease in the skin of his body, and the priest shall pronounce him unclean. <sup>z</sup>He shall not shut him up, for he is unclean. <sup>12</sup>And if the leprous disease breaks out in the skin, so that the leprous disease covers all the skin of the diseased person from head to foot, so far as the priest can see, <sup>13</sup>then the priest shall look, and if the leprous disease has covered all his body, he shall pronounce him clean of the disease; it has all turned white, and he is clean. <sup>14</sup>But when raw flesh appears on him, he shall be unclean. <sup>15</sup>And the priest shall examine the raw flesh and pronounce him unclean. Raw flesh is unclean, for it is a leprous disease. <sup>16</sup>But if the raw flesh recovers and turns white again, then he shall come to the priest, <sup>17</sup>and the priest shall examine him, and if the disease has turned white, then the priest shall pronounce the diseased person clean; he is clean.</p>
<p><sup>18</sup>&#8220;If there is in the skin of one&#8217;s body a <sup>a</sup>boil and it heals, <sup>19</sup>and in the place of the boil there comes a white swelling or a <sup>b</sup>reddish-white spot, then it shall be shown to the priest. <sup>20</sup>And the priest shall look, and if it appears deeper than the skin and its hair has turned white, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean. It is a case of leprous disease that has broken out in the boil. <sup>21</sup>But if the priest examines it and there is no white hair in it and it is not deeper than the skin, but has faded, then the priest shall shut him up seven days. <sup>22</sup>And if it spreads in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean; it is a disease. <sup>23</sup>But <sup>c</sup>if the spot remains in one place and does not spread, it is the scar of the boil, and the priest shall pronounce him clean.</p>
<p><sup>24</sup>&#8220;Or, when the body has a burn on its skin and the raw flesh of the burn becomes a spot, <sup>d</sup>reddish-white or white, <sup>25</sup>the priest shall examine it, and if the hair in the spot has turned white and it appears deeper than the skin, then it is a leprous disease. It has broken out in the burn, and the priest shall pronounce him unclean; it is a case of leprous disease. <sup>26</sup>But if the priest examines it and there is no white hair in the spot and it is no deeper than the skin, but has faded, the priest shall shut him up seven days, <sup>27</sup>and the priest shall examine him the seventh day. If it is spreading in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean; it is a case of leprous disease. <sup>28</sup>But if the spot remains <sup>e</sup>in one place and does not spread in the skin, but has faded, it is a swelling from the burn, and the priest shall pronounce him clean, for it is the scar of the burn.</p>
<p><sup>29</sup>&#8220;When a man or woman has a disease on the head or the beard, <sup>30</sup>the priest shall examine the disease. And if it appears deeper than the skin, and the hair in it is yellow and thin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean. It is an itch, a leprous disease of the head or the beard. <sup>31</sup>And if the priest examines the itching disease and it appears no deeper than the skin and there is no black hair in it, then the priest shall shut up the person with the itching disease for seven days, <sup>32</sup>and on the seventh day the priest shall examine the disease. If the itch has not spread, and there is in it no yellow hair, and the itch appears to be no deeper than the skin, <sup>33</sup>then he shall shave himself, but the itch he shall not shave; and the priest shall shut up the person with the itching disease for another seven days. <sup>34</sup>And on the seventh day the priest shall examine the itch, and if the itch has not spread in the skin and it appears to be no deeper than the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him clean. And <sup>f</sup>he shall wash his clothes and be clean. <sup>35</sup>But if the itch spreads in the skin after his cleansing, <sup>36</sup>then the priest shall examine him, and if the itch has spread in the skin, the priest need not seek for the yellow hair; he is unclean. <sup>37</sup>But if in his eyes the itch is unchanged and black hair has grown in it, the itch is healed and he is clean, and the priest shall pronounce him clean.</p>
<p><sup>38</sup>&#8220;When a man or a woman has spots on the skin of the body, white spots, <sup>39</sup>the priest shall look, and if the spots on the skin of the body are of a dull white, it is leukoderma that has broken out in the skin; he is clean.</p>
<p><sup>40</sup>&#8220;If a man&#8217;s hair falls out from his head, he is bald; he is clean. <sup>41</sup>And if a man&#8217;s hair falls out from his forehead, he has baldness of the forehead; he is clean. <sup>42</sup>But if there is on the bald head or the bald forehead a reddish-white diseased area, it is a leprous disease breaking out on his bald head or his bald forehead. <sup>43</sup>Then the priest shall examine him, and if the diseased swelling is reddish-white on his bald head or on his bald forehead, like the appearance of leprous disease in the skin of the body, <sup>44</sup>he is a leprous man, he is unclean. The priest must pronounce him unclean; his disease is on his head.</p>
<p><sup>45</sup>&#8220;The leprous person who has the disease shall wear torn clothes and <sup>g</sup>let the hair of his head hang loose, and he shall <sup>h</sup>cover his upper lip<sup>1</sup> and cry out, <sup>i</sup>&#8216;Unclean, unclean.&#8217; <sup>46</sup>He shall remain unclean as long as he has the disease. He is unclean. He shall live alone. His dwelling shall be <sup>j</sup>outside the camp.</p>
<p><sup>47</sup>&#8220;When there is a case of leprous disease in a <sup>k</sup>garment, whether a woolen or a linen garment, <sup>48</sup>in warp or woof of linen or wool, or in a skin or in anything made of skin, <sup>49</sup>if the disease is greenish or reddish in the garment, or in the skin or in the warp or the woof or in any article made of skin, it is a case of leprous disease, and it shall be shown to the priest. <sup>50</sup>And the priest shall examine the disease and shut up that which has the disease for seven days. <sup>51</sup>Then he shall examine the disease on the seventh day. If the disease has spread in the garment, in the warp or the woof, or in the skin, whatever be the use of the skin, the disease is a <sup>l</sup>persistent leprous disease; it is unclean. <sup>52</sup>And he shall burn the garment, or the warp or the woof, the wool or the linen, or any article made of skin that is diseased, for it is a persistent leprous disease. It shall be burned in the fire.</p>
<p><sup>53</sup>&#8220;And if the priest examines, and if the disease has not spread in the garment, in the warp or the woof or in any article made of skin, <sup>54</sup>then the priest shall command that they wash the thing in which is the disease, and he shall shut it up for another seven days. <sup>55</sup>And the priest shall examine the diseased thing after it has been washed. And if the appearance of the diseased area has not changed, though the disease has not spread, it is unclean. You shall burn it in the fire, whether the rot is on the back or on the front.</p>
<p><sup>56</sup>&#8220;But if the priest examines, and if the diseased area has faded after it has been washed, he shall tear it out of the garment or the skin or the warp or the woof. <sup>57</sup>Then if it appears again in the garment, in the warp or the woof, or in any article made of skin, it is spreading. You shall burn with fire whatever has the disease. <sup>58</sup>But the garment, or the warp or the woof, or any article made of skin from which the disease departs when you have washed it, shall then be washed a second time, and be clean.&#8221;</p>
<p><sup>59</sup>This is the law for a case of leprous disease in a garment of wool or linen, either in the warp or the woof, or in any article made of skin, to determine whether it is clean or unclean.</p>

<p>The <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> spoke to Moses, saying, <sup>2</sup>&#8220;This shall be the law of the leprous person for the day of his cleansing. <sup>m</sup>He shall be brought to the priest, <sup>3</sup>and the priest shall go <sup>n</sup>out of the camp, and the priest shall look. Then, if the case of leprous disease is healed in the leprous person, <sup>4</sup>the priest shall command them to take for him who is to be cleansed two live<sup>1</sup> clean birds and <sup>o</sup>cedarwood and <sup>p</sup>scarlet yarn and <sup>q</sup>hyssop. <sup>5</sup>And the priest shall command them to kill one of the birds in an earthenware vessel over fresh<sup>2</sup> water. <sup>6</sup>He shall take the live bird with the cedarwood and the scarlet yarn and the hyssop, and dip them and the live bird in the blood of the bird that was killed over the fresh water. <sup>7</sup>And he shall <sup>r</sup>sprinkle it <sup>s</sup>seven times on him who is to be cleansed of the leprous disease. Then he shall pronounce him clean and shall <sup>t</sup>let the living bird go <sup>u</sup>into the open field. <sup>8</sup>And he who is to be cleansed <sup>v</sup>shall wash his clothes and shave off all his hair and bathe himself in water, and he shall be clean. And after that he may come into the camp, but <sup>w</sup>live outside his tent seven days. <sup>9</sup>And <sup>x</sup>on the seventh day he shall shave off all his hair from his head, his beard, and his eyebrows. He shall shave off all his hair, and then he <sup>v</sup>shall wash his clothes and bathe his body in water, and he shall be clean.</p>
<p><sup>10</sup>&#8220;And on the eighth day he <sup>y</sup>shall take two male lambs without blemish, and one ewe lamb a year old without blemish, and a <sup>z</sup>grain offering of three tenths of an ephah<sup>3</sup> of fine flour mixed with oil, and one log<sup>4</sup> of oil. <sup>11</sup>And the priest who cleanses him shall set the man who is to be cleansed and these things before the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, at the entrance of the tent of meeting. <sup>12</sup>And the priest shall take one of the male lambs and <sup>a</sup>offer it for a guilt offering, along with the log of oil, and <sup>b</sup>wave them for a wave offering before the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>. <sup>13</sup>And he shall kill the lamb <sup>c</sup>in the place where they kill the sin offering and the burnt offering, in the place of the sanctuary.

<p><sup>48</sup>&#8220;But if the priest comes and looks, and if the disease has not spread in the house after the house was plastered, then the priest shall pronounce the house clean, for the disease is healed. <sup>49</sup>And for the <sup>a</sup>cleansing of the house he shall take <sup>b</sup>two small birds, with cedarwood and scarlet yarn and hyssop, <sup>50</sup>and shall kill one of the <sup>c</sup>birds in an earthenware vessel over fresh water <sup>51</sup>and shall take the <sup>d</sup>cedarwood and the hyssop and the scarlet yarn, along with the live bird, and dip them in the blood of the bird that was killed and in the fresh water and sprinkle the house seven times. <sup>52</sup>Thus he shall cleanse the house with the blood of the bird and with the fresh water and with the live bird and with the cedarwood and <sup>e</sup>hyssop and scarlet yarn. <sup>53</sup>And he shall let the live bird go out of the city <sup>f</sup>into the open country. So he shall <sup>g</sup>make atonement for the house, and it shall be clean.&#8221;</p>
<p><sup>54</sup>This is the law for any case of leprous disease: for <sup>h</sup>an itch, <sup>55</sup>for <sup>i</sup>leprous disease in a garment or in <sup>j</sup>a house, <sup>56</sup>and <sup>k</sup>for a swelling or an eruption or a spot, <sup>57</sup>to <sup>l</sup>show when it is unclean and when it is clean. This is the law for leprous disease.</p>
<h2 id="leviticus-article-laws-about-bodily-discharges">Laws About Bodily Discharges</h2>
<p><strong>15</strong></p>
<p>The <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying, <sup>2</sup>&#8220;Speak to the people of Israel and say to them, <sup>m</sup>When any man has a discharge from his body,<sup>1</sup> his discharge is unclean. <sup>3</sup>And this is the law of his uncleanness for a discharge: whether his body runs with his discharge, or his body is blocked up by his discharge, it is his uncleanness. <sup>4</sup>Every bed on which the one with the discharge lies shall be unclean, and everything on which he sits shall be unclean. <sup>5</sup>And anyone who touches his bed <sup>n</sup>shall wash his clothes and <sup>o</sup>bathe himself in water and be unclean until the evening. <sup>6</sup>And whoever sits on anything on which the one with the discharge has sat shall <sup>p</sup>wash his clothes and bathe himself in water and be unclean until the evening. <sup>7</sup>And whoever touches the body of the one with the discharge shall wash his clothes and bathe himself in water and be unclean until the evening. <sup>8</sup>And if the one with the discharge spits on someone who is clean, then he shall wash his clothes and bathe himself in water and be unclean until the evening. <sup>9</sup>And any saddle on which the one with the discharge rides shall be unclean. <sup>10</sup>And whoever touches anything that was under him shall be unclean until the evening. And whoever carries such things shall wash his clothes and bathe himself in water and be unclean until the evening. <sup>11</sup>Anyone whom the one with the discharge touches without having rinsed his hands in water shall wash his clothes and bathe himself in water and be unclean until the evening. <sup>12</sup>And an <sup>q</sup>earthenware vessel that the one with the discharge touches shall be broken, and every vessel of wood shall be rinsed in water.</p>
<p><sup>13</sup>&#8220;And when the one with a discharge is cleansed of his discharge, then <sup>r</sup>he shall count for himself seven days for his cleansing, and wash his clothes. And he shall bathe his body in fresh water and shall be clean. <sup>14</sup>And on the <sup>s</sup>eighth day he shall take two <sup>t</sup>turtledoves or two pigeons and come before the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> to the entrance of the tent of meeting and give them to the priest. <sup>15</sup>And the priest shall use them, <sup>u</sup>one for a sin offering and the other for a burnt offering. <sup>v</sup>And the priest shall make atonement for him before the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> for his discharge.</p>
<p><sup>16</sup><sup>w</sup>&#8220;If a man has an emission of semen, he shall bathe his whole body in water and be unclean until the evening. <sup>17</sup>And every garment and every skin on which the semen comes shall be washed with water and be unclean until the evening. <sup>18</sup>If a man lies with a woman and has an emission of semen, both of them shall bathe themselves in water and <sup>x</sup>be unclean until the evening.</p>
<p><sup>19</sup>&#8220;When a woman has a discharge, and the discharge in her body is blood, she shall be in her <sup>y</sup>menstrual impurity for seven days, and whoever touches her shall be unclean until the evening. <sup>20</sup><sup>z</sup>And everything on which she lies during her menstrual impurity shall be unclean. Everything also on which she sits shall be unclean. <sup>21</sup>And whoever touches her bed shall wash his clothes and bathe himself in water and be unclean until the evening. <sup>22</sup>And whoever touches anything on which she sits shall wash his clothes and bathe himself in water and be unclean until the evening. <sup>23</sup>Whether it is the bed or anything on which she sits, when he touches it he shall be unclean until the evening. <sup>24</sup>And <sup>a</sup>if any man lies with her and her menstrual impurity comes upon him, he shall be unclean seven days, and every bed on which he lies shall be unclean.</p>
<p><sup>25</sup>&#8220;If <sup>b</sup>a woman has a discharge of blood for many days, not at the time of her menstrual impurity, or if she has a discharge beyond the time of her impurity, all the days of the discharge she shall continue in uncleanness. As in the days of her impurity, she shall be unclean. <sup>26</sup>Every bed on which she lies, all the days of her discharge, shall be to her as the bed of her impurity. And everything on which she sits shall be unclean, as in the uncleanness of her menstrual impurity. <sup>27</sup>And whoever touches these things shall be unclean, and shall wash his clothes and bathe himself in water and be unclean until the evening. <sup>28</sup>But <sup>c</sup>if she is cleansed of her discharge, she shall count for herself seven days, and after that she shall be clean. <sup>29</sup>And on the eighth day she shall take two <sup>d</sup>turtledoves or two pigeons and bring them to the priest, to the entrance of the tent of meeting. <sup>30</sup>And the priest shall use one for a sin offering and the other for a burnt offering. And the priest shall make atonement for her before the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> for her unclean discharge.</p>
<p><sup>31</sup>&#8220;Thus you shall keep the people of Israel separate from their uncleanness, lest they die in their uncleanness by <sup>e</sup>defiling my tabernacle that is in their midst.&#8221;</p>
<p><sup>32</sup>This is the law <sup>f</sup>for him who has a discharge and <sup>g</sup>for him who has an emission of semen, becoming unclean thereby; <sup>33</sup><sup>h</sup>also for her who is unwell with her menstrual impurity, that is, for anyone, <sup>f</sup>male or <sup>i</sup>female, who has a discharge, and for the <sup>j</sup>man who lies with a woman who is unclean.</p>
<h2 id="leviticus-article-the-day-of-atonement">The Day of Atonement</h2>
<p><strong>16</strong></p>
<p>The <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> spoke to Moses after <sup>k</sup>the death of the two sons of Aaron, when they drew near before the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> and died, <sup>2</sup>and the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> said to Moses, &#8220;Tell Aaron your brother not to <sup>l</sup>come at any time into the Holy Place inside the veil, before the mercy seat that is on the ark, so that he may not die. For <sup>m</sup>I will appear in the cloud over the mercy seat. <sup>3</sup>But in this way Aaron shall come into the Holy Place: <sup>n</sup>with a bull from the herd for a sin offering and <sup>o</sup>a ram for a burnt offering. <sup>4</sup>He shall put on <sup>p</sup>the holy linen coat and shall have the linen undergarment on his body, and he shall tie the linen sash around his waist, and wear the linen turban; these are the holy garments. <sup>q</sup>He shall bathe his body in water and then put them on. <sup>5</sup>And he shall take from <sup>r</sup>the congregation of the people of Israel two male goats for a sin offering, and one ram for a burnt offering.</p>
<p><sup>6</sup>&#8220;Aaron shall <sup>s</sup>offer the bull as a sin offering for himself and shall <sup>t</sup>make atonement for himself and for his house. <sup>7</sup>Then he shall take the two goats and set them before the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> at the entrance of the tent of meeting. <sup>8</sup>And Aaron shall cast lots over the two goats, one lot for the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> and the other lot for <sup>u</sup>Azazel.<sup>1</sup> <sup>9</sup>And Aaron shall present the goat on which the lot fell for the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> and use it as a sin offering, <sup>10</sup>but the goat on which the lot fell for <sup>u</sup>Azazel shall be presented alive before the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> to make atonement over it, that it may be sent away into the wilderness to <sup>u</sup>Azazel.</p>
<p><sup>11</sup>&#8220;Aaron shall present <sup>s</sup>the bull as a sin offering for himself, and shall make atonement for himself and for his house. He shall kill the bull as a sin offering for himself. <sup>12</sup>And he shall take <sup>v</sup>a censer full of coals of fire from the altar before the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, and two handfuls of sweet <sup>w</sup>incense beaten small, and he shall bring it inside the veil <sup>13x</sup>and put the incense on the fire before the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, that the cloud of the incense may cover <sup>y</sup>the mercy seat that is over the testimony, so that he does not die. <sup>14</sup>And <sup>z</sup>he shall take some of the blood of the bull and sprinkle it with his finger on the front of the mercy seat on the east side, and in front of the mercy seat he shall sprinkle some of the blood with his finger seven times.</p>
<p><sup>15a</sup>&#8220;Then he shall kill the goat of the sin offering that is for the people and bring its blood <sup>b</sup>inside the veil and do with its blood as he did with the blood of the bull, sprinkling it over the mercy seat and in front of the mercy seat. <sup>16</sup>Thus he shall <sup>c</sup>make atonement for the Holy Place, because of the uncleannesses of the people of Israel and because of their transgressions, all their sins. And so he shall do for the tent of meeting, which dwells with them in the midst of their uncleannesses. <sup>17d</sup>No one may be in the tent of meeting from the time he enters to make <sup>e</sup>atonement in the Holy Place until he comes out and has made atonement for himself and for his house and for all the assembly of Israel. <sup>18</sup>Then he shall go out to the altar that is <sup>f</sup>before the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> and <sup>g</sup>make atonement for it, and shall take some of the blood of the bull and some of the blood of the goat, and put it on the horns of the altar all around. <sup>19</sup>And he shall sprinkle some of the blood on it with his finger seven times, and cleanse it and consecrate it from the uncleannesses of the people of Israel.</p>
<p><sup>20</sup>&#8220;And when he has made an end of <sup>h</sup>atoning for the Holy Place and the tent of meeting and the altar, he shall present the live goat. <sup>21</sup>And Aaron shall lay both his hands on the head of the live goat, and confess over it all the iniquities of the people of Israel, and all their transgressions, all their sins.

<h2 id="leviticus-article-when-you-fast">When You Fast</h2>
<h3 id="afflicting-ones-soul">Afflicting One&#8217;s Soul</h3>
<p>The modern Jewish calendar has 28 fasting days, but in the Old Testament, God commanded only one annual fast. In <a class="bible" href="3016029-3016031" title="Leviticus 16:29-31">Lv 16:29&#8211;31</a>, Moses gave God&#8217;s dictum to &#8220;afflict [deny] yourselves&#8221; on the Day of Atonement (Yom Kippur). In response to the atonement for Israel&#8217;s corporate sin, devout Israelites would fast from morning until evening on the tenth day of the seventh month.</p>
<p>Before the exile to Babylon, Israelites fasted during times of impending danger, mourning, sickness, threat of war, distress, and sorrow. For example, Hannah did not eat because of the great stress brought about by her barrenness (<a class="bible" href="9001007-9001007" title="1 Samuel 1:7">1Sm 1:7</a>), and David fasted after learning of Abner&#8217;s death (<a class="bible" href="9003035-9003035" title="2 Samuel 3:35">2Sm 3:35</a>). Religious leaders also mandated periods of fasting at times of great national crisis (cf <a class="bible" href="7020026-7020026" title="Judges 20:26">Jgs 20:26</a>; <a class="bible" href="14020003-14020003" title="2 Chronicles 20:3">2Ch 20:3</a>; <a class="bible" href="24036009-24036009" title="Jeremiah 36:9">Jer 36:9</a>). These examples show that fasting was an expression of sorrow and, most important, an expression of repentance.</p>
<h3 id="overindulgence">Overindulgence</h3>
<p>Where faith is strongest, Satan works hardest. While God esteems those who are &#8220;humble and contrite in spirit&#8221; (<a class="bible" href="23066002-23066002" title="Isaiah 66:2">Is 66:2</a>), Satan vigorously attacks them with temptations to overindulge. Thankfully, God did not leave His people powerless in their sin. In answer to prayer, God sent Isaiah to call passionately for their repentance and help them understand the true character of fasting as an expression of sorrow over sin and an opportunity to have mercy on the hungry (<a class="bible" href="23058003-23058008" title="Isaiah 58:3-8">Is 58:3&#8211;8</a>).</p>
<p>Unfortunately, instead of heeding God&#8217;s call, the people continued in their self-centeredness and thus brought about the Babylonian exile. For God&#8217;s people, the Babylonian exile and the destruction of the first temple by Nebuchadnezzar (587 <span class="time">bc</span>) was a turning point in history rivaled only by the Roman destruction of Herod&#8217;s temple (<span class="time">ad</span> 70). As a result of the exile, four new fasts were added to the Jewish calendar, each marking key historical dates leading up to and including the exile (<a class="bible" href="38008018-38008019" title="Zechariah 8:18-19">Zec 8:18&#8211;19</a>). For instance, a fast in the fourth month laments the breach of Jerusalem&#8217;s outer wall by Nebuchadnezzar (<a class="bible" href="24052006-24052007" title="Jeremiah 52:6-7">Jer 52:6&#8211;7</a>). A fast in the fifth month commemorates the burning of God&#8217;s holy temple and other buildings (<a class="bible" href="12025008-12025009" title="2 Kings 25:8-9">2Ki 25:8&#8211;9</a>), while a fast in the seventh month marks the assassination of Gedaliah, whom the king of Babylon had placed as governor over Judah (<a class="bible" href="38007005-38007005" title="Zechariah 7:5">Zec 7:5</a>). Finally, a fast during the tenth month is held in memory of Nebuchadnezzar&#8217;s siege of Jerusalem (<a class="bible" href="12025001-12025001" title="2 Kings 25:1">2Ki 25:1</a>). These fasts served a holy purpose: they reminded the Israelites of the sorrows brought by neglecting God&#8217;s Word. However, over time fasting became another way the Israelites abused God&#8217;s Word.</p>
<p>In the hope of preventing any further captivity, Jewish scholars pored over the writings of Moses, frantically searching for a reason why God exiled them. They determined to apply the Law more vigorously. What followed was a fundamental shift in their belief system. To this day, many people still believe that if they keep all the laws perfectly, they will gain salvation. Fasting changed from an expression of repentance to compulsory appeasement of a legalistic code. This deception led many astray to spend eternity apart from the Lord, who desires to save all people (<a class="bible" href="54002003-54002004" title="1 Timothy 2:3-4">1Tm 2:3&#8211;4</a>).</p>
<h3 id="the-appearing-of-christ">The Appearing of Christ</h3>
<p>Before the birth of Jesus, the Pharisees mandated twice-weekly fasting (<a class="bible" href="42018009-42018012" title="Luke 18:9-12">Lk 18:9&#8211;12</a>). The Essenes, a splinter group that may have lived at Qumran, centered much of their lives on fasting. For the unfaithful, fasting was something done to curry God&#8217;s favor&#8212;a duty, a work, a law. But for the faithful, fasting continued as an expression of repentance and reverence for the Lord, who created them and promised to redeem them.</p>
<p>After Jesus&#8217; Baptism, He went into the wilderness and fasted for 40 days and 40 nights (<a class="bible" href="40004002-40004002" title="Matthew 4:2">Mt 4:2</a>). This recalled the devotion of Moses (<a class="bible" href="2024018-2024018" title="Exodus 24:18">Ex 24:18</a>), the great prophet Elijah (<a class="bible" href="11019008-11019008" title="1 Kings 19:8">1Ki 19:8</a>), and the 40 years of wilderness wandering for Israel. During this fast, Satan repeatedly tempted Jesus, but He used God&#8217;s precious Word to defend Himself.</p>
<h3 id="fasting-for-you">Fasting for You</h3>
<p>During the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus spoke against fasting as a means of salvation. Instead, He commended fasting as a private, voluntary act of humility before God (<a class="bible" href="40006016-40006018" title="Matthew 6:16-18">Mt 6:16&#8211;18</a>). Take a few moments now to read His words and reflect on your own devotion. If you are like most people, you have thought more about dieting than fasting. It is hard to imagine a daylong fast. No doubt fasting for 40 days like Jesus did after His Baptism is out of the question. Yet our Lord&#8217;s words clearly reveal that fasting should be part of a Christian&#8217;s life: He said, &#8220;When you fast&#8221; (<a class="bible" href="40006016-40006016" title="Matthew 6:16">Mt 6:16</a>), not &#8220;If you fast&#8221; (cf <a class="bible" href="40009014-40009015" title="Matthew 9:14-15">Mt 9:14&#8211;15</a>). The early Christians fasted (<a class="bible" href="44013002-44013003" title="Acts 13:2-3">Ac 13:2&#8211;3</a>; <a class="bible" href="44014023-44014023" title="Acts 14:23">14:23</a>). Why shouldn&#8217;t a twenty-first-century Christian do likewise?</p>
<p>As you fast, let the feelings of hunger you experience remind you to pray. Spend the time you would normally spend eating by reading God&#8217;s Word and meditating on the Gospel of Jesus Christ. Through His Word, the Lord will bless and nourish you. &#8220;Then shall your light break forth like the dawn, and your healing shall spring up speedily; your righteousness shall go before you; the glory of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> shall be your rear guard. Then you shall call, and the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> will answer; you shall cry, and He will say, &#8216;Here I am&#8217; &#8221; (<a class="bible" href="23058008-23058009" title="Isaiah 58:8-9">Is 58:8&#8211;9</a>).</p>
<h2 id="leviticus-article-how-you-might-fast">How You Might Fast</h2>
<p>Consider fasting for a meal or two before partaking of the Lord&#8217;s Supper. Spend your extra time studying God&#8217;s Word and singing Communion hymns.</p>
<p>Fasting during Lent can be a wonderful way to remember the perfect obedience of Christ and His sacrifice for your salvation. Money not spent on food may be donated for the poor.</p>
<p>You might follow this routine for a daylong fast: (1) rise before dawn and eat breakfast; (2) examine yourself as you would prior to partaking of the Lord&#8217;s Supper; (3) offer your life to God in penitent prayer; (4) go about your day, breaking your fast at evening.</p>
<p>If you are diabetic, fasting could be hazardous. Check with your doctor.Do not consider fasting as a dieting program.</p>
<p>If abstaining from food is not possible, consider abstaining from something else. For example, turn off your television and spend time in prayer and study of God&#8217;s Word.</p>
<p><sup>23</sup>&#8220;Then Aaron shall come into the tent of meeting and <sup>m</sup>shall take off the linen garments that he put on when he went into the Holy Place and shall leave them there. <sup>24</sup>And he shall bathe his body in water in a holy place and put on his garments and come out and <sup>n</sup>offer his burnt offering and the burnt offering of the people and make atonement for himself and for the people. <sup>25</sup>And <sup>o</sup>the fat of the sin offering he shall burn on the altar. <sup>26</sup>And he who lets the goat go to <sup>p</sup>Azazel shall wash his clothes and <sup>q</sup>bathe his body in water, and afterward he may come into the camp. <sup>27r</sup>And the bull for the sin offering and the goat for the sin offering, whose blood was brought in to make atonement in the Holy Place, shall be carried outside the camp. Their skin and their flesh and their dung shall be burned up with fire. <sup>28</sup>And he who burns them shall wash his clothes and bathe his body in water, and afterward he may come into the camp.</p>
<p><sup>29</sup>&#8220;And it shall be a <sup>s</sup>statute to you forever that <sup>t</sup>in the seventh month, on the tenth day of the month, you shall <sup>u</sup>afflict yourselves<sup>1</sup> and shall do no work, either <sup>v</sup>the native or the stranger who sojourns among you. <sup>30</sup>For on this <sup>w</sup>day shall atonement be made for you <sup>x</sup>to cleanse you. You shall be clean before the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> from all your sins. <sup>31y</sup>It is a Sabbath of solemn rest to you, and you shall <sup>u</sup>afflict yourselves; it is a statute forever. <sup>32z</sup>And the priest who is anointed and <sup>a</sup>consecrated as priest in his father&#8217;s place <sup>b</sup>shall make atonement, wearing the holy linen garments. <sup>33</sup>He shall make atonement for <sup>c</sup>the holy sanctuary, and he shall make atonement for the tent of meeting and for <sup>d</sup>the altar, and he shall make atonement for <sup>e</sup>the priests and for <sup>f</sup>all the people of the assembly. <sup>34</sup>And this shall be a statute forever for you, that atonement may be made for the people of Israel <sup>g</sup>once in the year because of all their sins.&#8221; And Moses did as the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> commanded him.</p>

He has shed <sup>j</sup>blood, and that man <sup>k</sup>shall be cut off from among his people. <sup>5</sup>This is to the end that the people of Israel may bring their sacrifices that they sacrifice <sup>l</sup>in the open field, that they may bring them to the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, to the priest at the entrance of the tent of meeting, and sacrifice them <sup>m</sup>as sacrifices of peace offerings to the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>. <sup>6</sup>And the priest shall <sup>m</sup>throw the blood on the altar of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> at the entrance of the tent of meeting and burn the fat <sup>n</sup>for a pleasing aroma to the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>. <sup>7</sup>So they shall no more <sup>o</sup>sacrifice their sacrifices to goat demons, after whom they <sup>p</sup>whore. This shall be a <sup>q</sup>statute forever for them throughout their generations.</p>
<p><sup>8</sup>&#8220;And you shall say to them, Any one of the house of Israel, or of the strangers who sojourn among them, who <sup>r</sup>offers a burnt offering or sacrifice <sup>9</sup>and <sup>s</sup>does not bring it to the <sup>t</sup>entrance of the <sup>u</sup>tent of meeting to offer it to the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, <sup>k</sup>that man shall be cut off from his people.</p>

<p><sup>13</sup>&#8220;Any one also of the people of Israel, or of the strangers who sojourn among them, who takes in hunting any beast or bird that may be eaten shall <sup>a</sup>pour out its blood and <sup>b</sup>cover it with earth. <sup>14</sup>For the life of every creature<sup>1</sup> is its <sup>c</sup>blood: its blood is its life.<sup>2</sup> Therefore I have said to the people of Israel, You shall not eat the blood of any creature, for the life of every creature is its blood.

<p><sup>10t</sup>&#8220;The priest who is chief among his brothers, on whose head the anointing oil is poured and who has been consecrated to wear the garments, <sup>u</sup>shall not let the hair of his head hang loose nor tear his clothes. <sup>11</sup>He shall not <sup>v</sup>go in to any dead bodies nor make himself <sup>w</sup>unclean, even for his father or for his mother. <sup>12x</sup>He shall not go out of the sanctuary, lest he <sup>y</sup>profane the sanctuary of his God, for the <sup>z</sup>consecration of the anointing oil of his God is on him: I am the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>. <sup>13</sup>And he shall take a wife in her <sup>a</sup>virginity.<sup>1</sup> <sup>14</sup>A widow, <sup>b</sup>or a divorced woman, or a woman who has been defiled, or a prostitute, these he shall not marry.

<p><sup>16</sup>And the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> spoke to Moses, saying, <sup>17</sup>&#8220;Speak to Aaron, saying, None of your <sup>c</sup>offspring throughout their generations who has a blemish may <sup>d</sup>approach to offer the bread of his God. <sup>18</sup>For no one who has a <sup>e</sup>blemish shall draw near, a man <sup>f</sup>blind or lame, or one who has a mutilated face <sup>g</sup>or a limb too long, <sup>19</sup>or a man who has an injured foot or an injured hand, <sup>20</sup>or a hunchback or a dwarf or a man with a <sup>f</sup>defect in his sight or an itching disease or scabs or <sup>h</sup>crushed testicles. <sup>21</sup>No man of the offspring of Aaron the priest who has a blemish shall come near to <sup>i</sup>offer the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>&#8217;s food offerings; since he has a blemish, he shall not come near to offer the bread of his God. <sup>22</sup>He may eat the bread of his God, both of <sup>j</sup>the most holy and of the <sup>k</sup>holy things, <sup>23</sup>but he shall not go through the veil or approach the altar, because he has a blemish, that he may not <sup>l</sup>profane my sanctuaries, <sup>m</sup>for I am the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> who sanctifies them.&#8221; <sup>24</sup>So Moses spoke to Aaron and to his sons and to all the people of Israel.</p>

<h3 id="bible-feasts-and-the-church-year">Bible Feasts and the Church Year</h3>
<p>As Jews, the earliest Christians followed the Israelite calendar and its feasts as observed by first-century Judaism. However, as more and more Gentiles came to faith in Jesus as their Savior, a new yearly pattern of worship emerged: the Church Year, which most Christians continue to observe today. The Israelite year was organized around the rhythm of the agricultural seasons in Israel and national events. By contrast, the Church Year was organized around the life and teachings of Jesus.</p>
<p>Two Church festivals descend directly from Israelite feast days: Easter and Pentecost. For centuries, the early Christians referred to Easter as Pasch, from the Hebrew word for Passover. The name <em>Pentecost</em> comes from the Greek word for 50, since Israelites and Christians celebrated this feast 50 days after Passover. These annual celebrations remind us of the Old Testament roots of the Church as well as the transformation of worship in view of the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus. Study the chart below to grow in your understanding of the Jewish and Christian calendars.</p>

<h3 id="holy-time-today">Holy Time Today</h3>
<p>In Christ, every day is the day of salvation (<a class="bible" href="47006002-47006002" title="2 Corinthians 6:2">2Co 6:2</a>). Yet the patterns of our holidays continue to serve us by serving God&#8217;s purposes. They call to mind God&#8217;s blessings. They organize our thoughts around the works of His mercy. And, perhaps most important, they draw God&#8217;s people together in celebration, to encourage one another through His Word (<a class="bible" href="58010025-58010025" title="Hebrews 10:25">Heb 10:25</a>).</p>
<p>When the pace of life or the demands of the holidays overwhelm you, pause and remember the Sabbath rest and the feast of blessings provided for you through the Lord of the Sabbath, Jesus Christ (<a class="bible" href="40011028-40012028" title="Matthew 11:28-12:8">Mt 11:28&#8211;12:8</a>).</p>
<h2 id="leviticus-article-the-lamb-of-god">The Lamb of God</h2>
<p>Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world&#8221; (<a class="bible" href="43010029-43010029" title="John 1:29">John 1:29</a>), John the Baptist, the last Old Testament prophet, said, pointing at Jesus Christ. This is the One whose sole purpose is not to moralize over issues of politics or history or being politically correct or incorrect. No, His sol[e] task is to take away the sin of the world. All kinds of roles ascribed to Him outside of this great mission nullify this great message, &#8220;This is the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world.&#8221; &#8230;</p>
<p>For the believing Jews the words of John the Baptist had to remind [of] bondage and deliverance. They were slaves in Egypt. God delivered them from that terrible bondage in a miraculous way. As the Angel of the Lord was passing through the land of captivity, he was killing all the first-born in Egypt. Consequences of being part of the sinful oppression never touched Israelites sojourning in that god-less country. They had a lamb. They put blood of the lamb on the door-posts, they ate the body of the roasted lamb without breaking its bones. They ate the lamb, lamb&#8217;s blood was on their doorways and death had not touched them. Christ was with His people there foreshadowing [inexpressible] love of the Triune God in the coming Incarnate Lamb of God. Now a prophet of the Lord is standing at the Jordan River and points at Jesus Christ and says, &#8220;Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world.&#8221; &#8230;</p>
<p>A Passover lamb in Egypt and the lambs sacrificed by Israelites as it was commanded by God were pointing at this true Lamb of God, Jesus Christ that sacrificed Himself for our sake on the Cross of Calvary. There He brought all our sins to wash them away with His holy, innocent blood and in a minute of His holy death to proclaim &#8220;It is finished!&#8221;</p>
<p>Bp. Dr. Vyacheslav Horpynchuk, &#8220;Behold, the Lamb of God!&#8221; (sermon, January 20, 2008).</p>
<h2 id="leviticus-article-the-heart-of-the-atonement">The Heart of the Atonement</h2>
<p>The] English word for <em>atonement</em> can be derived from the [words] &#8220;at-one,&#8221; i.e. making reconcilement or putting at-one. The Old Testament is full of &#8230; examples when people sacrifice a dove, sheep, goats or ox in order to cover up or to abolish their guilt. For this purpose Israelites had the Day of Atonement&#8230;. But all this was only &#8220;types&#8221; or &#8220;shadows&#8221; that were &#8220;preparing the way&#8221; for the coming Christ. The Old Testament is full (or&#8212;&#8220;pregnant&#8221;) with prophecies and traditions that show &#8230; Christ.</p>
<p>Some modern scholars say that the traditional doctrine of the Atonement is too much influenced by the Old Testament. They can see only the horrible death of Christ on a cross&#8230;. They deny even the possibility that Christ could die in order to satisfy God&#8217;s justice and to forgive our sins. Some can see only a righteous man who died for us. This way they limit the Atonement Christ made.&#8230;</p>
<p>Vicarious satisfaction is the heart of the Atonement and is the Scriptural teaching. Other doctrines such as victory over the devil and death are consequences of the Christ&#8217;s work. Therefore it is correct to say that the Atonement in a narrow sense is vicarious satisfaction&#8230;. In a wider sense it embrace[s] not only the death of Christ for [our] sins but also His incarnation, temptations, victory over the devil and death. It is not possible to accomplish for a mere man, but only for a God-Man.</p>

<h2 id="leviticus-article-the-feast-of-booths">The Feast of Booths</h2>
<p><sup>33</sup>And the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> spoke to Moses, saying, <sup>34</sup>&#8220;Speak to the people of Israel, saying, <sup>l</sup>On the fifteenth day of this seventh month and for seven days is the <sup>m</sup>Feast of Booths<sup>1</sup> to the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>. <sup>35</sup>On the first day shall be a holy convocation; you shall not do any ordinary work. <sup>36</sup>For seven days you shall present food offerings to the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>. <sup>n</sup>On the eighth day you shall hold a holy convocation and present a food offering to the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>. It is a <sup>o</sup>solemn assembly; you shall not do any ordinary work.</p>
<p><sup>37p</sup>&#8220;These are the appointed feasts of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, which you shall proclaim as times of holy convocation, for presenting to the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> food offerings, burnt offerings and grain offerings, sacrifices and drink offerings, each on its proper day, <sup>38q</sup>besides the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>&#8217;s Sabbaths and besides your gifts and besides all your vow offerings and besides all your freewill offerings, which you give to the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>.</p>
<p><sup>39</sup>&#8220;On the fifteenth day of the seventh month, when you have <sup>r</sup>gathered in the produce of the land, you shall celebrate the feast of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> seven days. On the first day shall be a solemn rest, and on the eighth day shall be a solemn rest. <sup>40</sup>And <sup>s</sup>you shall take on the first day the fruit of splendid trees, branches of palm trees and boughs of leafy trees and willows of the brook, and <sup>t</sup>you shall rejoice before the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> your God seven days. <sup>41u</sup>You shall celebrate it as a feast to the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> for seven days in the year. It is a <sup>v</sup>statute forever throughout your generations; you shall celebrate it in the seventh month. <sup>42w</sup>You shall dwell in booths for seven days. All native Israelites shall dwell in booths, <sup>43</sup>that <sup>x</sup>your generations may know that I made the people of Israel dwell in booths when I brought them out of the land of Egypt: I am the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> your God.&#8221;</p>
<p><sup>44</sup>Thus Moses <sup>y</sup>declared to the people of Israel the appointed feasts of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>.</p>
<h2 id="leviticus-article-the-lamps">The Lamps</h2>
<p><strong>24</strong></p>
<p><sup>z</sup>The <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> spoke to Moses, saying, <sup>2</sup>&#8220;Command the people of Israel to bring you pure oil from beaten olives for the lamp, that a light may be kept burning regularly. <sup>3</sup>Outside the veil of the testimony, in the tent of meeting, Aaron shall arrange it from evening to morning before the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> regularly. It shall be a <sup>a</sup>statute forever throughout your generations. <sup>4</sup>He shall arrange the lamps on the <sup>b</sup>lampstand of pure gold<sup>2</sup> before the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> regularly.</p>
<h2 id="leviticus-article-bread-for-the-tabernacle">Bread for the Tabernacle</h2>
<p><sup>5</sup>&#8220;You shall take fine flour and bake twelve <sup>c</sup>loaves from it; two tenths of an ephah<sup>3</sup> shall be in each loaf. <sup>6</sup>And you shall set them in two piles, six in a pile, <sup>d</sup>on the table of pure gold<sup>4</sup> before the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>. <sup>7</sup>And you shall put pure frankincense on each pile, that it may go with the bread as a memorial portion as a food offering to the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>. <sup>8e</sup>Every Sabbath day Aaron shall arrange it before the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> regularly; it is from the people of Israel as a covenant forever. <sup>9</sup>And <sup>f</sup>it shall be for Aaron and his sons, and <sup>g</sup>they shall eat it in a holy place, since it is for him a most holy portion out of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>&#8217;s food offerings, a perpetual due.&#8221;</p>
<h2 id="leviticus-article-punishment-for-blasphemy">Punishment for Blasphemy</h2>
<p><sup>10</sup>Now an Israelite woman&#8217;s son, whose father was an Egyptian, went out among the people of Israel. And the Israelite woman&#8217;s son and a man of Israel fought in the camp, <sup>11</sup>and the Israelite woman&#8217;s son <sup>h</sup>blasphemed the <sup>i</sup>Name, and cursed. Then they <sup>j</sup>brought him to Moses. His mother&#8217;s name was Shelomith, the daughter of Dibri, of the tribe of Dan. <sup>12</sup>And <sup>k</sup>they put him in custody, <sup>l</sup>till the will of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> should be clear to them.</p>
<p><sup>13</sup>Then the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> spoke to Moses, saying, <sup>14m</sup>&#8220;Bring out of the camp the one who cursed, and let all who heard him <sup>n</sup>lay their hands on his head, and let all the congregation stone him. <sup>15</sup>And speak to the people of Israel, saying, Whoever curses his God shall <sup>o</sup>bear his sin. <sup>16</sup>Whoever <sup>p</sup>blasphemes the name of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> shall surely be put to death. All the congregation shall stone him. The sojourner as well as the native, when he blasphemes the Name, shall be put to death.</p>

The ark was a box covered with gold, 44 in. long by 26.4 in. wide and high, with carrying poles for the wilderness journey to the Promised Land. Centered within the tabernacle (portable temple), the ark was later placed within Solomon&#8217;s permanent temple.</p>
<p>Once a year, the high priest entered the Most Holy Place to appear before the Lord (<a class="bible" href="3016034-3016034" title="Leviticus 16:34">Lv 16:34</a>). This part of the Day of Atonement ceremony included sprinkling of the blood from animals upon the cover of the ark of the covenant (<a class="bible" href="3016014-3016014" title="Leviticus 16:14">Lv 16:14</a>). Israelite people prayed over animals to be sacrificed, placing on them their own sin and guilt (<a class="bible" href="3016021-3016021" title="Leviticus 16:21">Lv 16:21</a>). Blood was a substance that embodied both physical and spiritual life, and it was sprinkled on the sacred space between the cherubim.</p>

<p>The ark contained the stone tablets of the Decalogue (the Ten Commandments), prompting the name &#8220;ark of the covenant&#8221; (<a class="bible" href="5010005-5010005" title="Deuteronomy 10:5">Dt 10:5</a>). The tablets of God&#8217;s Law delivered to Moses at Mount Sinai functioned as the constitution for the Israelite nation. Later, a jar of manna from the desert wandering (<a class="bible" href="2016033-2016033" title="Exodus 16:33">Ex 16:33</a>) and Aaron&#8217;s rod (<a class="bible" href="4017010-4017010" title="Numbers 17:10">Nu 17:10</a>) were stored in the ark as symbols of God&#8217;s deliverance.</p>

<h2 id="leviticus-article-the-sabbath-year">The Sabbath Year</h2>
<p><strong>25</strong></p>
<p><sup>w</sup>The <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> spoke to Moses on Mount Sinai, saying, <sup>2</sup>&#8220;Speak to the people of Israel and say to them, When you come into <sup>x</sup>the land that I give you, the land shall keep a Sabbath to the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>. <sup>3</sup>For <sup>y</sup>six years you shall sow your field, and for six years you shall prune your vineyard and gather in its fruits, <sup>4</sup>but in the seventh year there shall be a Sabbath of solemn rest for the land, a Sabbath to the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>. You shall not sow your field or prune your vineyard. <sup>5z</sup>You shall not reap what grows of itself in your harvest, or gather the grapes of your undressed vine. It shall be a year of solemn rest for the land. <sup>6</sup>The Sabbath of the land shall provide food for you, for yourself and for your male and female slaves and for your hired servant and the sojourner who lives with you, <sup>7</sup>and for your cattle and for the wild animals that are in your land: <sup>a</sup>all its yield shall be for food.</p>
<h2 id="leviticus-article-the-year-of-jubilee">The Year of Jubilee</h2>
<p><sup>8</sup>&#8220;You shall count seven weeks<sup>1</sup> of years, seven times seven years, so that the time of the seven weeks of years shall give you forty-nine years. <sup>9</sup>Then you shall sound <sup>b</sup>the loud trumpet on the tenth day of the seventh month. <sup>c</sup>On the Day of Atonement you shall sound the trumpet throughout all your land. <sup>10</sup>And you shall consecrate the fiftieth year, and <sup>d</sup>proclaim liberty throughout the land to all its inhabitants. It shall be a jubilee for you, when each of you shall return to his property and each of <sup>e</sup>you shall return to his clan. <sup>11</sup>That fiftieth year shall be a jubilee for you; in it <sup>f</sup>you shall neither sow nor reap <sup>z</sup>what grows of itself nor gather the grapes from the undressed vines. <sup>12</sup>For it is a jubilee. It shall be holy to you. <sup>g</sup>You may eat the produce of the field.<sup>1</sup></p>
<p><sup>13e</sup>&#8220;In this year of jubilee each of you shall return to his property. <sup>14</sup>And if you make a sale to your neighbor or buy from your neighbor, <sup>h</sup>you shall not wrong one another. <sup>15i</sup>You shall pay your neighbor according to the number of years after the jubilee, and he shall sell to you according to the number of years for crops. <sup>16</sup>If the years are many, you shall increase the price, and if the years are few, you shall reduce the price, for it is the number of the crops that he is selling to you. <sup>17j</sup>You shall not wrong one another, but you shall fear your God, for I am the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> your God.</p>
<p><sup>18k</sup>&#8220;Therefore you shall do my statutes and keep my rules and perform them, and then <sup>l</sup>you will dwell in the land securely. <sup>19m</sup>The land will yield its fruit, and <sup>n</sup>you will eat your fill <sup>l</sup>and dwell in it securely. <sup>20</sup>And if you say, <sup>o</sup>&#8216;What shall we eat in the seventh year, if <sup>p</sup>we may not sow or gather in our crop?&#8217; <sup>21</sup>I will <sup>q</sup>command my blessing on you in the sixth year, so that it will produce a crop sufficient for three years. <sup>22r</sup>When you sow in the eighth year, you will be eating some of <sup>s</sup>the old crop; you shall eat the old until the ninth year, when its crop arrives.</p>
<h2 id="leviticus-article-redemption-of-property">Redemption of Property</h2>
<p><sup>23</sup>&#8220;The land shall not be sold in perpetuity, for <sup>t</sup>the land is mine. For you are strangers and <sup>u</sup>sojourners with me. <sup>24</sup>And in all the country you possess, you shall allow a redemption of the land.</p>
<p><sup>25</sup>&#8220;If your brother becomes poor and sells part of his property, <sup>v</sup>then his nearest redeemer shall come and redeem what his brother has sold. <sup>26</sup>If a man has no one to redeem it and then himself becomes prosperous and finds sufficient means to redeem it, <sup>27</sup>let <sup>w</sup>him calculate the years since he sold it and pay back the balance to the man to whom he sold it, and then return to his property. <sup>28</sup>But if he has not sufficient means to recover it, then what he sold shall remain in the hand of the buyer until the year of jubilee. In the jubilee it shall <sup>x</sup>be released, and <sup>y</sup>he shall return to his property.</p>
<p><sup>29</sup>&#8220;If a man sells a dwelling house in a walled city, he may redeem it within a year of its sale. For a full year he shall have the right of redemption. <sup>30</sup>If it is not redeemed within a full year, then the house in the walled city shall belong in perpetuity to the buyer, throughout his generations; <sup>x</sup>it shall not be released in the jubilee. <sup>31</sup>But the houses of the villages that have no wall around them shall be classified with the fields of the land. They may be redeemed, and <sup>x</sup>they shall be released in the jubilee. <sup>32</sup>As for <sup>z</sup>the cities of the Levites, the Levites may redeem at any time the houses in the cities they possess. <sup>33</sup>And if one of the Levites exercises his right of redemption, then the house that was sold in a city they possess shall be released in the jubilee. For the houses in the cities of the Levites are their possession among the people of Israel. <sup>34</sup>But the fields <sup>a</sup>of pastureland belonging to their cities may not be sold, for that is their possession forever.</p>
<h2 id="leviticus-article-freedom-rest-and-redemption">Freedom, Rest, and Redemption</h2>
<p>This article examines three aspects of Jubilee: (1) the care of the land; (2) the redemption of land, homes, and people; and (3) the treatment of the poor. It will provide you with a firm understanding of this special Sabbath and its emphasis on freedom for God&#8217;s people.</p>
<h3 id="care-of-the-land">Care of the Land</h3>
<p>Long before the first Israelite set foot in Canaan, God made land provisions for each tribe and family. In addition, the Levites were given 48 cities and adjoining lands in all 12 tribal areas. God remained the landowner, while the Israelites were His tenants (<a class="bible" href="3025023-3025024" title="Leviticus 25:23-24">Lv 25:23&#8211;24</a>). This was the same relationship God had with Adam, whom He placed in the Garden of Eden &#8220;to work it and take care of it&#8221; (<a class="bible" href="1002015-1002015" title="Genesis 2:15">Gn 2:15</a>). It is also the same relationship God wants in our lives.</p>
<p>God commanded the Israelites to care for their land through a period of Sabbath rest every seven years (<a class="bible" href="3025001-3025007" title="Leviticus 25:1-7">Lv 25:1&#8211;7</a>). When the Sabbath rest came, the Israelites were to let their fields go fallow. They trusted God to provide enough harvest in the sixth year to sustain them through the eighth. This cycle lasted seven successive seven-year periods. Then that year&#8217;s Day of Atonement ushered in the celebration of Jubilee.</p>
<p>In the 50th year, the 7th month, on the 10th day, a trumpet blast marked the beginning of this unique feast. (The word <em>jubilee</em> comes from <em>yobel</em>, a Hebrew word for &#8220;ram&#8217;s horn trumpet.&#8221;) The sound called every Israelite back to his or her original land. It also marked a second Sabbath year for the land (<a class="bible" href="3025011-3025012" title="Leviticus 25:11-12">Lv 25:11&#8211;12</a>). God assured His people that they would harvest enough in the 48th year to last the three years of the Sabbath year, the Jubilee, and the wait for the next year&#8217;s harvest (<a class="bible" href="3025021-3025021" title="Leviticus 25:21">Lv 25:21</a>).</p>
<p>Since God owned the land, it was never sold, only leased. Payments were based on the number of harvests until Jubilee (<a class="bible" href="3025013-3025016" title="Leviticus 25:13-16">Lv 25:13&#8211;16</a>). More harvests meant a higher lease payment. God knew that the Israelites would be tempted to take advantage of their countrymen in financial matters (<a class="bible" href="3025017-3025017" title="Leviticus 25:17">Lv 25:17</a>). He also knew that they would exhaust the land in their pursuit of success. The Sabbath and Jubilee festivals addressed these issues and taught the Israelites to depend on the Lord for their prosperity.</p>
<h3 id="redemption">Redemption</h3>
<p>One of the most important aspects of Jubilee was redemption. For example, impoverished Israelites who leased their land could redeem it if they or a kinsman paid the value of the lease for the number of years remaining until Jubilee. Only a kinsman could redeem the land.</p>
<p>A kinsman could also redeem homes (except if the home was in a walled city). Homes in walled cities were limited by a one-year redemption proviso, after which they could not be redeemed, not even at Jubilee (<a class="bible" href="3025029-3025030" title="Leviticus 25:29-30">Lv 25:29&#8211;30</a>). Since the homes of Levites were found only in walled cities, God made an exemption for them. Their homes were redeemable at any time, as was the case for all homes in villages without walls. If a Levite&#8217;s home was not redeemed, it had to be returned during Jubilee. Although Levites could sell their home, they could not sell any of the pastureland near their home, since it provided food for their livestock (<a class="bible" href="3025031-3025034" title="Leviticus 25:31-34">Lv 25:31&#8211;34</a>; <a class="bible" href="4035002-4035005" title="Numbers 35:2-5">Nu 35:2&#8211;5</a>).</p>
<p>The Israelite people could also be redeemed. At any time, a relative could secure release for a man and his family forced into slavery by economic hardship (<a class="bible" href="3025047-3025049" title="Leviticus 25:47-49">Lv 25:47&#8211;49</a>). If a man became prosperous, he could redeem himself (<a class="bible" href="300049b-300049b" title="verse 49b">v 49b</a>). Regardless, all Israelite slaves were released at Jubilee (<a class="bible" href="3025040-3025040" title="Leviticus 25:40">Lv 25:40</a>). Any Israelite in the possession of a foreigner or another Israelite was to be treated as a hired hand because he belonged to God. What was the redemption rate for Israelites? <a class="bible" href="3025050-3025050" title="Leviticus 25:50">Lv 25:50</a> states that the buyer and seller were to count the number of years until Jubilee and then multiply that figure by the rate paid a hired man. Redemption applied only to the Israelite people. Their foreign slaves were never subject to release and could be willed as inherited property (<a class="bible" href="3025046-3025046" title="Leviticus 25:46">Lv 25:46</a>).</p>
<h3 id="treatment-of-the-poor">Treatment of the Poor</h3>
<p>God commanded that during a Jubilee, His people should care for their poorer countrymen by lending them money at no interest and selling them food at no profit (<a class="bible" href="3025035-3025038" title="Leviticus 25:35-38">Lv 25:35&#8211;38</a>). God never wants the poor mistreated, so He strictly commanded His people to treat the poor with respect and never take advantage of them. Notice how He sternly reminds them to love the poor out of respect for Him, remembering how He redeemed them in Egypt (<a class="bible" href="3025037-3025038" title="Leviticus 25:37-38">Lv 25:37&#8211;38</a>). God also prevented the wealthy from amassing great tracts of land at the expense of the poor by commanding its return during Jubilee.</p>
<h3 id="our-sabbath-and-jubilee">Our Sabbath and Jubilee</h3>
<p>God&#8217;s Word continually calls sinners to repent and live in God-given rest and freedom. Throughout <a class="bible" href="3000025-3000025" title="Leviticus 25">Lv 25</a>, the Lord reminded the Israelites that He had set them free, that He had redeemed them (<a class="bible" href="3025038-3025038,3025042-3025042,3025055-3025055" title="Leviticus 25:38; Leviticus 25:42; Leviticus 25:55">25:38, 42, 55</a>). Today, God&#8217;s Word reminds us of the Redeemer of all people. Jesus our Kinsman has set us free. His precious blood has redeemed us from the slavery of sin (<a class="bible" href="58002014-58002018" title="Hebrews 2:14-18">Heb 2:14&#8211;18</a>). That is true cause for jubilation!</p>
<h2 id="leviticus-article-kindness-for-poor-brothers">Kindness for Poor Brothers</h2>
<p><sup>35</sup>&#8220;If your brother becomes poor and cannot maintain himself with you, <sup>b</sup>you shall support him as though he were a stranger and a sojourner, and he shall live with you. <sup>36c</sup>Take no interest from him or profit, but <sup>d</sup>fear your God, that your brother may live beside you. <sup>37c</sup>You shall not lend him your money at interest, nor give him your food for profit. <sup>38e</sup>I am the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt to give you the land of Canaan, and to be your God.</p>
<p><sup>39f</sup>&#8220;If your brother becomes poor beside you and sells himself to you, you shall not make him serve as a slave: <sup>40</sup>he shall be with you as a hired servant and as a sojourner. He shall serve with you until the year of the jubilee. <sup>41x</sup>Then he shall go out from you, <sup>g</sup>he and his children with him, and go back to his own clan and return <sup>h</sup>to the possession of his fathers. <sup>42</sup>For they are <sup>i</sup>my servants,<sup>1</sup> whom I brought out of the land of Egypt; they shall not be sold as slaves. <sup>43j</sup>You shall not rule over him <sup>k</sup>ruthlessly but <sup>l</sup>shall fear your God. <sup>44</sup>As for your male and female slaves whom you may have: you may buy male and female slaves from among the nations that are around you. <sup>45m</sup>You may also buy from among the strangers who sojourn with you and their clans that are with you, who have been born in your land, and they may be your property. <sup>46</sup>You may bequeath them to your sons after you to inherit as a possession forever. You may make slaves of them, but over your brothers the people of Israel <sup>n</sup>you shall not rule, one over another ruthlessly.</p>
<h2 id="leviticus-article-redeeming-a-poor-man">Redeeming a Poor Man</h2>
<p><sup>47</sup>&#8220;If a stranger or sojourner with you becomes rich, and <sup>o</sup>your brother beside him becomes poor and sells himself to the stranger or sojourner with you or to a member of the stranger&#8217;s clan, <sup>48</sup>then after he is sold he may be redeemed. One of his brothers may redeem him, <sup>49</sup>or his uncle or his cousin may <sup>p</sup>redeem him, or a close relative from his clan may redeem him. Or if he <sup>q</sup>grows rich he may redeem himself. <sup>50</sup>He shall calculate with his buyer from the year when he sold himself to him until the year of jubilee, and the price of his sale shall vary with the number of years. The time he was with his owner shall be <sup>r</sup>rated as the time of a hired servant. <sup>51</sup>If there are still many years left, he shall pay proportionately for his redemption some of his sale price. <sup>52</sup>If there remain but a few years until the year of jubilee, he shall calculate and pay for his redemption in proportion to his years of service. <sup>53</sup>He shall treat him as a servant hired year by year. <sup>n</sup>He shall not rule ruthlessly over him in your sight. <sup>54</sup>And if he is not redeemed by these means, then <sup>s</sup>he and his children with him shall be released in the year of jubilee. <sup>55</sup>For it is <sup>t</sup>to me that the people of Israel are servants.<sup>2</sup> They are my servants whom I brought out of the land of Egypt: <sup>u</sup>I am the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> your God.</p>
<h2 id="leviticus-article-blessings-for-obedience">Blessings for Obedience</h2>
<p><strong>26</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;You shall not make <sup>v</sup>idols for yourselves or erect an <sup>w</sup>image or <sup>x</sup>pillar, and you shall not set up a <sup>y</sup>figured stone in your land to bow down to it, for I am the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> your God. <sup>2z</sup>You shall keep my Sabbaths and reverence my sanctuary: I am the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>.</p>
<p><sup>3a</sup>&#8220;If you walk in my statutes and observe my commandments and do them, <sup>4</sup>then <sup>b</sup>I will give you your rains in their season, and the land shall yield its increase, and the trees of the field shall yield their fruit. <sup>5c</sup>Your threshing shall last to the time of the grape harvest, and the grape harvest shall last to the time for sowing. And <sup>d</sup>you shall eat your bread to the full and <sup>e</sup>dwell in your land securely. <sup>6f</sup>I will give peace in the land, and <sup>g</sup>you shall lie down, and none shall make you afraid. And <sup>h</sup>I will remove harmful beasts from the land, <sup>i</sup>and the sword shall not go through your land. <sup>7</sup>You shall chase your <sup>j</sup>enemies, and they shall fall before you by the sword. <sup>8k</sup>Five of you shall chase a hundred, and a hundred of you shall chase ten thousand, and your enemies shall fall before you by the sword. <sup>9l</sup>I will turn to you and <sup>m</sup>make you fruitful and multiply you and will confirm my covenant with you. <sup>10</sup>You shall eat <sup>n</sup>old store long kept, and you shall clear out the old to make way for the new. <sup>11o</sup>I will make my dwelling<sup>1</sup> among you, and my soul shall not abhor you. <sup>12p</sup>And I <sup>q</sup>will walk among you and will be your God, and you shall be my people. <sup>13r</sup>I am the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, that you should not be their slaves. <sup>s</sup>And I have broken the bars of your yoke and made you walk erect.</p>
<h2 id="leviticus-article-punishment-for-disobedience">Punishment for Disobedience</h2>
<p><sup>14t</sup>&#8220;But if you will not listen to me and will not do all these commandments, <sup>15</sup>if you spurn my statutes, and if your soul abhors my rules, so that you will not do all my commandments, but <sup>u</sup>break my covenant, <sup>16</sup>then I will do this to you: I will visit you with panic, with <sup>v</sup>wasting disease and fever that consume the eyes and make the heart ache. And <sup>w</sup>you shall sow your seed in vain, for your enemies shall eat it. <sup>17</sup>I will <sup>x</sup>set my face against you, and <sup>y</sup>you shall be struck down before your enemies. <sup>z</sup>Those who hate you shall rule over you, and <sup>a</sup>you shall flee when none pursues you. <sup>18</sup>And if in spite of this you will not listen to me, then I will discipline you again <sup>b</sup>sevenfold for your sins, <sup>19</sup>and I will break <sup>c</sup>the pride of your power, and I <sup>d</sup>will make your heavens like iron and your earth like bronze. <sup>20</sup>And <sup>e</sup>your strength shall be spent in vain, for <sup>f</sup>your land shall not yield its increase, and the trees of the land shall not yield their fruit.</p>
<p><sup>21g</sup>&#8220;Then if you walk contrary to me and will not listen to me, I will continue striking you, sevenfold for your sins. <sup>22</sup>And <sup>h</sup>I will let loose the wild beasts against you, which shall bereave you of your children and destroy your livestock and make you few in number, so that <sup>i</sup>your roads shall be deserted.</p>
<p><sup>23</sup>&#8220;And <sup>j</sup>if by this discipline you are not turned to me <sup>g</sup>but walk contrary to me, <sup>24k</sup>then I also will walk contrary to you, and I myself will strike you sevenfold for your sins. <sup>25</sup>And <sup>l</sup>I will bring a sword upon you, that shall execute vengeance for the covenant. And if you gather within your cities, <sup>m</sup>I will send pestilence among you, and you shall be delivered into the hand of the enemy. <sup>26n</sup>When I break your supply<sup>1</sup> of bread, ten women shall bake your bread in a single oven and shall dole out your bread again by weight, and <sup>o</sup>you shall eat and not be satisfied.</p>
<p><sup>27</sup>&#8220;But <sup>p</sup>if in spite of this you will not listen to me, but walk contrary to me, <sup>28</sup>then I will walk contrary to you <sup>q</sup>in fury, and I myself will discipline you <sup>b</sup>sevenfold for your sins. <sup>29r</sup>You shall eat the flesh of your sons, and you shall eat the flesh of your daughters. <sup>30</sup>And <sup>s</sup>I will destroy your high places and cut down your incense altars and <sup>t</sup>cast your dead bodies upon the dead bodies of your idols, and my soul will abhor you. <sup>31</sup>And I will <sup>u</sup>lay your cities waste and will <sup>v</sup>make your sanctuaries desolate, and <sup>w</sup>I will not smell your pleasing aromas. <sup>32</sup>And <sup>x</sup>I myself will devastate the land, so that your enemies who settle in it shall be <sup>y</sup>appalled at it. <sup>33</sup>And <sup>z</sup>I will scatter you among the nations, and I will unsheathe the sword after you, and your land shall be a desolation, and your cities shall be a waste.</p>
<p><sup>34a</sup>&#8220;Then the land shall enjoy<sup>2</sup> its Sabbaths as long as it lies desolate, while you are in your enemies&#8217; land; then the land shall rest, and enjoy its Sabbaths. <sup>35</sup>As long as it lies desolate it shall have rest, the rest that it did not have on your Sabbaths when you were dwelling in it. <sup>36</sup>And as for those of you who are left, <sup>b</sup>I will send faintness into their hearts in the lands of their enemies. The <sup>c</sup>sound of a <sup>d</sup>driven leaf shall put them to flight, and they shall <sup>e</sup>flee as one flees from the sword, and they shall fall when none pursues. <sup>37</sup>They shall stumble over one another, as if to escape a sword, though none pursues. And <sup>f</sup>you shall have no power to stand before your enemies. <sup>38</sup>And you shall perish among the nations, and the land of your enemies shall eat you up. <sup>39</sup>And those of you who are left shall <sup>g</sup>rot away in your enemies&#8217; lands because of their iniquity, and also because of the iniquities of their fathers they shall rot away like them.</p>
<p><sup>40</sup>&#8220;But if <sup>h</sup>they confess their iniquity and the iniquity of their fathers in their treachery that they <sup>i</sup>committed against me, and also in walking contrary to me, <sup>41</sup>so that I walked contrary to them and brought them into the land of their enemies&#8212;if then their <sup>j</sup>uncircumcised heart is <sup>k</sup>humbled and they make amends for their iniquity, <sup>42</sup>then I will <sup>l</sup>remember my covenant with Jacob, and I will remember my covenant with Isaac and my covenant with Abraham, and I will <sup>m</sup>remember the land. <sup>43</sup>But <sup>a</sup>the land shall be abandoned by them and enjoy its Sabbaths while it lies desolate without them, and they shall make <sup>n</sup>amends for their iniquity, because they spurned my rules and their soul abhorred my statutes. <sup>44</sup>Yet for all that, when they are in the land of their enemies, <sup>o</sup>I will not spurn them, neither will I abhor them so as to destroy them utterly and <sup>p</sup>break my covenant with them, for I am the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> their God. <sup>45</sup>But I will for their sake <sup>q</sup>remember the covenant with their forefathers, <sup>r</sup>whom I brought out of the land of Egypt <sup>s</sup>in the sight of the nations, that I might be their God: I am the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>.&#8221;</p>

<p>The <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> spoke to Moses, saying, <sup>2</sup>&#8220;Speak to the people of Israel and say to them, If anyone <sup>v</sup>makes a special vow to the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> involving the valuation of persons, <sup>3</sup>then the valuation of a male from twenty years old up to sixty years old shall be fifty shekels<sup>1</sup> of silver, according to the <sup>w</sup>shekel of the sanctuary. <sup>4</sup>If the person is a female, the valuation shall be thirty shekels. <sup>5</sup>If the person is from five years old up to twenty years old, the valuation shall be for a male twenty shekels, and for a female ten shekels. <sup>6</sup>If the person is from a month old up to five years old, the valuation shall be for a male five shekels of silver, and for a female the valuation shall be three shekels of silver. <sup>7</sup>And if the person is sixty years old or over, then the valuation for a male shall be fifteen shekels, and for a female ten shekels. <sup>8</sup>And if someone is too poor to pay the valuation, then he shall be made to stand before the priest, and the priest shall value him; the priest shall value him according to what the vower can afford.</p>
<p><sup>9</sup>&#8220;If the vow<sup>2</sup> is an animal that may be offered as an offering to the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, all of it that he gives to the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> is holy. <sup>10x</sup>He shall not exchange it or make a substitute for it, good for bad, or bad for good; and if he does in fact substitute one animal for another, then both it and the substitute shall be holy. <sup>11</sup>And if it is any unclean animal that may not be offered as an offering to the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, then he shall stand the animal before the priest, <sup>12</sup>and the priest shall value it as either good or bad; as the priest values it, so it shall be. <sup>13y</sup>But if he wishes to redeem it, he shall add a <sup>z</sup>fifth to the valuation.</p>
<p><sup>14</sup>&#8220;When a man dedicates his house as a holy gift to the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, the priest shall value it as either good or bad; as the priest values it, so it shall stand. <sup>15a</sup>And if the donor wishes to redeem his house, he shall add a <sup>z</sup>fifth to the valuation price, and it shall be his.</p>
<p><sup>16</sup>&#8220;If a man dedicates to the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> part of the land that is his possession, then the valuation shall be in proportion to its seed. A homer<sup>3</sup> of barley seed shall be valued at fifty shekels of silver. <sup>17</sup>If he dedicates his field from the year of jubilee, the valuation shall stand, <sup>18</sup>but if he dedicates his field after the jubilee, then the priest shall <sup>b</sup>calculate the price according to the years that remain until the year of jubilee, and a deduction shall be made from the valuation. <sup>19c</sup>And if he who dedicates the field wishes to redeem it, then he shall add a <sup>z</sup>fifth to its valuation price, and it shall remain his. <sup>20</sup>But if he does not wish to redeem the field, or if he has sold the field to another man, it shall not be redeemed anymore. <sup>21</sup>But the field, <sup>d</sup>when it is released in the jubilee, shall be a holy gift to the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, like a field that has been <sup>e</sup>devoted. The priest shall be in <sup>f</sup>possession of it. <sup>22</sup>If he dedicates to the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> a field that he has bought, <sup>g</sup>which is not a part of his possession, <sup>23h</sup>then the priest shall calculate the amount of the valuation for it up to the year of jubilee, and the man shall give the valuation on that day as a holy gift to the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>. <sup>24i</sup>In the year of jubilee the field shall return to him from whom it was bought, to whom the land belongs as a possession. <sup>25</sup>Every valuation shall be according to <sup>j</sup>the shekel of the sanctuary: <sup>k</sup>twenty gerahs<sup>4</sup> shall make a shekel.</p>
<p><sup>26</sup>&#8220;But a <sup>l</sup>firstborn of animals, which as a firstborn belongs to the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, no man may dedicate; whether ox or sheep, it is the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>&#8217;s. <sup>27</sup>And if it is an unclean animal, then he shall buy it back at the valuation, <sup>m</sup>and add a fifth to it; or, if it is not redeemed, it shall be sold at the valuation.</p>
<p><sup>28</sup>&#8220;But <sup>n</sup>no devoted thing that a man devotes to the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, of anything that he has, whether man or beast, or of his inherited field, shall be sold or redeemed; every devoted thing is most holy to the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>. <sup>29o</sup>No one devoted, who is to be devoted for <sup>p</sup>destruction<sup>5</sup> from mankind, shall be ransomed; he shall surely be put to death.</p>
<p><sup>30q</sup>&#8220;Every tithe of the land, whether of the seed of the land or of the fruit of the trees, is the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>&#8217;s; it is holy to the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>. <sup>31</sup>If a man wishes to redeem some of his tithe, he shall add a fifth to it. <sup>32</sup>And every tithe of herds and flocks, every tenth animal of all that <sup>r</sup>pass under the herdsman&#8217;s staff, shall be holy to the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>. <sup>33</sup>One shall not differentiate between good or bad, <sup>s</sup>neither shall he make a substitute for it; and if he does substitute for it, then both it and the substitute shall be holy; it shall not be redeemed.&#8221;</p>
<p><sup>34t</sup>These are the commandments that the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> commanded Moses for the people of Israel <sup>u</sup>on Mount Sinai.</p>

Moses wrote Lv under divine inspiration. Ancient Israelites knew Lv as &#8220;Now He (God) Called,&#8221; a name that emphasized God&#8217;s actions instead of the ceremonial rites performed by Levites (&#8220;Leviticus&#8221; comes from the <span class="bible-version">LXX</span>). God continues the dialogue with Moses begun at the burning bush (<a class="bible" href="2000003-2000003" title="Exodus 3">Ex 3</a>), beginning some 33 times with &#8220;the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> spoke to Moses&#8221; (e.g., <a class="bible" href="3004001-3004001" title="Leviticus 4:1">4:1</a>; <a class="bible" href="3005014-3005014" title="Leviticus 5:14">5:14</a>; <a class="bible" href="3008001-3008001" title="Leviticus 8:1">8:1</a>; <a class="bible" href="3018001-3018001" title="Leviticus 18:1">18:1</a>). <em>tent of meeting</em>.

Part of the household (see note, <a class="note" href="2020017-2020017" title="Exodus 20:17">Ex 20:17</a>) and representative of it. Israelites brought to the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> the firstborn of their animals (<a class="bible" href="3027026-3027026" title="Leviticus 27:26">27:26</a>) and tithed to Him (<a class="bible" href="3027032-3027032" title="Leviticus 27:32">27:32</a>). Archaeological discoveries show that animals offered by the Israelites were also offered by other nations. However, Canaanites sacrificed donkeys at Ugarit, Philistines had ritual burials for dogs, and Greeks sacrificed dogs, horses, and pigs.</p>

<p><strong><a class="note-id" href="3001003-3001003" title="Leviticus 1:3">1:3</a></strong> <em>burnt offering</em>. See pp 170&#8211;71. <em>without blemish</em>. Animals presented before God must be perfect, as He is perfect (<a class="bible" href="3022020-3022025" title="Leviticus 22:20-25">22:20&#8211;25</a>). &#8220;They were not called sacrifice because they merited the forgiveness of sins before God, but because they merited the forgiveness of sins according to the righteousness of the Law, so that those for whom they were made might not be excluded from that commonwealth &#8249;from the people of Israel&#8250;. Therefore, for a trespass, the sacrifices were called sin offerings and burnt offerings&#8221; (<a class="bible" href="3000021-3000021" title="Apology XXIV 21">Ap XXIV 21</a>). Animal sacrifices were commanded by God as a precursor to the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ at Calvary (<a class="bible" href="60001018-60001019" title="1 Peter 1:18-19">1Pt 1:18&#8211;19</a>). &#8220;We teach that the sacrifice of Christ dying on the cross has been enough for the sins of the whole world. There is no need for other sacrifices, as though Christ&#8217;s sacrifice were not enough for our sins. So people are justified not because of any other sacrifices, but because of this one sacrifice of Christ, if they believe that they have been redeemed by this sacrifice&#8221; (<a class="bible" href="3000008-3000008" title="Apology XIII 8">Ap XIII 8</a>).</p>

The sacrificial blood was collected in a basin and applied to the altar. <em>throw the blood against the sides of the altar</em>. A priest sprinkled the sacrificial blood on the sides of the altar in the rite of atonement: the animal&#8217;s death atoned for the life of the offerer.</p>

<p><strong><a class="note-id" href="3001008-3001008" title="Leviticus 1:8">1:8</a></strong> <em>the fat</em>. Many pagan religions believed that an animal&#8217;s power and strength were found in the fat and blood once the animal was sacrificed to their deities. To overturn this idea, God reserved the fat for Himself (<a class="bible" href="3003016-3003016" title="Leviticus 3:16">3:16</a>) and designated the blood for atonement (<a class="bible" href="3017011-3017011" title="Leviticus 17:11">17:11</a>). An Israelite found guilty of eating fat or drinking blood was &#8220;cut off from his people&#8221; (<a class="bible" href="3007025-3007027" title="Leviticus 7:25-27">7:25&#8211;27</a>).</p>

Thorough washing was necessary before the offering was incinerated on God&#8217;s holy altar. Uncleanliness desecrated God&#8217;s altar. <em>food offering</em>. Most assuredly, God does not eat in the sense that we eat. The altar fire turns the sacrifice into smoke, which ascends into God&#8217;s heavenly domain. <em>pleasing aroma to the</em> <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>. Indicates God&#8217;s acceptance of the offering and, therefore, acceptance of the offerer. Unlike pagan deities, God offers forgiveness. With sacrifices, people tried to manipulate these deities into providing rain, bringing forth abundant crops, or instilling power and strength.</p>

<p><strong><a class="note-id" href="3001010-3001010" title="Leviticus 1:10">1:10</a></strong> <em>male without blemish</em>. Males were less valuable to breeding stock because only one male was needed to populate a herd. Moreover, male animals were the head of the flock or herd and as such could represent the male head of the Israelite family for sacrificial purposes.</p>

Because the crop of the bird was unclean and could not be offered in sacrifices, it was placed in an ash heap on the east side of the altar (see diagram, p 139). The ash heap was cleaned up every morning (<a class="bible" href="3006010-3006011" title="Leviticus 6:10-11">6:10&#8211;11</a>).</p>

This priestly system culminates in the atoning sacrifice of Jesus Christ. Today, just as the Israelites faithfully confessed their sins and prayed to the Lord, present your confession of sins and prayers of repentance and faith before Him in the name of &#8220;the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!&#8221; (<a class="bible" href="43001029-43001029" title="John 1:29">Jn 1:29</a>). &#8226; Almighty Father, may we always rejoice in Your abundant grace, through Christ, our Lord.

The grain used was most likely wheat or, in some instances, barley. <em>frankincense</em>. Aromatic gum resin procured from three types of trees found in southern Arabia and East Africa.

Recognize that God made His people holy by grace, and in the Law He guides them away from the self-destructive customs of the nations. In the Gospel of Jesus Christ, believers have freedom from their sins, freedom to please God as His beloved, chosen people. &#8226; Lord, You saw us as sinners, yet loved us still. By Your grace, You washed us in the water of Baptism and made us new creations. Sustain us with the life-giving body and blood of Your Son. Send Your Holy Spirit to make us pure. Keep us as Your ambassadors, living examples of Your love for all people. Amen.</p>

(2) Homes in walled cities were redeemable only within the first year; otherwise, all family rights were forfeited. There were two exceptions: houses in rural villages (<a class="bible" href="3000031-3000031" title="verse 31">v 31</a>) and houses in towns belonging to the Levites (<a class="bible" href="3032034-3032034" title="verses 32-34">vv 32&#8211;34</a>).</p>

<p><strong><a class="note-id" href="3027009-3027091" title="Leviticus 27:9-10">27:9&#8211;10</a></strong> God knows men&#8217;s hearts. The temptation exists to substitute an animal of one species for another, so God prevents such actions by declaring, through His priests, that both animals were holy and not redeemable. Both animals then could be sold and the money used to support the sanctuary.</p>

After they were ascribed a value by the priests, they were sold, and the money was used to support the sanctuary.</p>

<p><strong><a class="note-id" href="3027014-3027025" title="Leviticus 27:14-25">27:14&#8211;25</a></strong> Dedicating, or devoting, items in the manner addressed here was often done in answer to prayer. Dedication offerings were different from votive (freewill) offerings. Dedication offerings belonged to God immediately (the offering was consecrated or holy), while votive offerings were made only when God answered a prayer. The most dramatic example of a votive offering is that of Hannah, who volunteered her young son Samuel to God (<a class="bible" href="9001021-9001028" title="1 Samuel 1:21-28">1Sm 1:21&#8211;28</a>). Family land offered to God was redeemable by paying one shekel per year for each area covered by a homer (c 8 bushels) of barley, less the number of years to the next Jubilee, and then adding one-fifth to the total. If an individual had already sold the land pledged to God, the land was forever forfeited to Him.</p>

<p><strong><a class="note-id" href="3027026-3027027" title="Leviticus 27:26-27">27:26&#8211;27</a></strong> Firstborn animals already belonged to God and were presented to the priests. Therefore, these animals could not be dedicated to God (<a class="bible" href="2013012-2013012" title="Exodus 13:12">Ex 13:12</a>). The dedication of unclean animals was permitted, but these were redeemed at their value plus one-fifth.</p>

<p><strong><a class="note-id" href="3027003-3027031" title="Chapter 27">Ch 27</a></strong> Lv concludes by showing how all God&#8217;s people are involved in the stewardship of God&#8217;s house. Based on how God has blessed them, each Israelite provides materials and finances for the maintenance of God&#8217;s sanctuary for the ongoing operation of the Divine Service. The collection of our offerings during the liturgy serves a parallel purpose (cf <a class="bible" href="44004034-44004034,44005011-44005011" title="Acts 4:34-5:11">Ac 4:34&#8211;5:11</a>). Our offerings are part of the holy work of God&#8217;s people for the benefit of the world (<a class="bible" href="45015027-45015027" title="Romans 15:27">Rm 15:27</a>; <a class="bible" href="47009012-47009012" title="2 Corinthians 9:12">2Co 9:12</a>). Through our offerings, we bear witness to what God has done through Calvary&#8217;s cross. &#8226; &#8220;What shall I render to the Lord for all His benefits to me? I will offer the sacrifice of thanksgiving and will call on the name of the Lord. I will take the cup of salvation and will call on the name of the Lord. I will pay my vows to the Lord now in the presence of all His people, in the courts of the Lord&#8217;s house, in the midst of you, O Jerusalem.&#8221; Amen. (<em>LSB</em>, p 176)</p>
