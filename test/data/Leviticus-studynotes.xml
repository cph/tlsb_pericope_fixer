Archaeological discoveries show that animals offered by the Israelites were also offered by other nations. However, Canaanites sacrificed donkeys at Ugarit, Philistines had ritual burials for dogs, and Greeks sacrificed dogs, horses, and pigs.</p>

Therefore, for a trespass, the sacrifices were called sin offerings and burnt offerings&#8221; (<a class="bible" href="3000021-3000021" title="Apology XXIV 21">Ap XXIV 21</a>). Animal sacrifices were commanded by God as a precursor to the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ at Calvary (<a class="bible" href="60001018-60001019" title="1 Peter 1:18-19">1Pt 1:18&#8211;19</a>). &#8220;We teach that the sacrifice of Christ dying on the cross has been enough for the sins of the whole world. There is no need for other sacrifices, as though Christ&#8217;s sacrifice were not enough for our sins. So people are justified not because of any other sacrifices, but because of this one sacrifice of Christ, if they believe that they have been redeemed by this sacrifice&#8221; (<a class="bible" href="3000008-3000008" title="Apology XIII 8">Ap XIII 8</a>).</p>

Many pagan religions believed that an animal&#8217;s power and strength were found in the fat and blood once the animal was sacrificed to their deities. To overturn this idea, God reserved the fat for Himself (<a class="bible" href="3003016-3003016" title="Leviticus 3:16">3:16</a>) and designated the blood for atonement (<a class="bible" href="3017011-3017011" title="Leviticus 17:11">17:11</a>).

<p><strong><a class="note-id" href="3000002-3000002" title="Chapter 2">Ch 2</a></strong> God provides His OT priests with food through the grain offering. The remaining grain becomes most holy once the priest burns the memorial portion. By grace, the priests are permitted to eat a sacred meal at God&#8217;s table. In this, God&#8217;s people may see a foreshadowing of Holy Communion. Today, at Christ&#8217;s invitation, we come to the Lord&#8217;s Table, where we receive the true body and blood of the Lord Jesus Christ, a holy meal God Himself prepares for the forgiveness of sins. &#8226; We give thanks to You, almighty God, that You have refreshed us through this salutary gift, and we implore You that of Your mercy You would strengthen our faith toward You and love for one another. Amen. (Adapted from <em>LSB</em>, p 166.)</p>

Because of sin, God could no longer dwell with the Israelites as He desired. To this end, God gave the sin offering for the deliverance of those who inadvertently sinned against Him (<a class="bible" href="3004020-3004020,3004026-3004026,3004031-3004031,3004035-3004035" title="confer 4:20; confer 4:26; confer 4:31; confer 4:35">cf 4:20, 26, 31, 35</a>).

Jesus Christ is the sin offering for all sins, for all time (<a class="bible" href="62002002-62002002" title="1 John 2:2">1Jn 2:2</a>; <a class="bible" href="3004010-3004010" title="Leviticus 4:10">4:10</a>). &#8226; How wonderful it is to hear the words of Absolution: &#8220;Almighty God in His mercy has given His Son to die for you and for His sake forgives you all your sins.&#8221; Amen.

The God who justifies sinners also condemns those who will not sanctify the Lord.

<p><strong><a class="note-id" href="3016002-3016034" title="Chapter 16">Ch 16</a></strong> Once a year, on the 10th day of the seventh month, God implemented a mandatory Day of Atonement. Ritual sacrifices cleansed the sanctuary, tent of meeting, altar, priests, and entire congregation of their sins. The chief cleansing agent was blood, which pointed forward to Jesus&#8217; sacrifice. By His death, Jesus offered the perfect sacrifice and entered the heavenly sanctuary with His blood (<a class="bible" href="58009011-58009014" title="Hebrews 9:11-14">Heb 9:11&#8211;14</a>), opening the way for believers to enter into God&#8217;s presence (<a class="bible" href="58006020-58006020" title="Hebrews 6:20">Heb 6:20</a>). &#8226; We give You thanks, Lord, for Your abundant mercy. You heard Your people&#8217;s prayers of repentance and sent Your precious Son to die for all. By His blood, we are made clean and enter into eternal life with You. Amen.</p>

<p><strong><a class="note-id" href="3018001-3018030" title="Chapter 18">Ch 18</a></strong> Sexual purity is so important to God that He issued decrees detailing how to protect it. Only intercourse between a husband and wife is approved by God. God speaks against sexual sins among Christians as well (<a class="bible" href="49005005-49005006" title="Ephesians 5:5-6">Eph 5:5&#8211;6</a>; <a class="bible" href="58013004-58013004" title="Hebrews 13:4">Heb 13:4</a>). The Gospel sets people free from sin, but that freedom is not an excuse for committing sin. God knows our hearts and provides marriage to protect us from sin (<a class="bible" href="46007002-46007002" title="1 Corinthians 7:2">1Co 7:2</a>). In faithfulness to His Church, He hallows us and provides for our forgiveness from all sins. &#8226; Lord of the Church, forgive me and protect my heart from all impurity. Keep me from sexual sin by the power of Your Holy Spirit. Amen.</p>

Today, Christ&#8217;s atoning death makes us members of God&#8217;s royal priesthood (<a class="bible" href="60002009-60002009" title="1 Peter 2:9">1Pt 2:9</a>). As members of His royal priesthood, God separates us from every defilement (<a class="bible" href="47007001-47007001" title="2 Corinthians 7:1">2Co 7:1</a>) and calls us to care for one another. &#8226; Lord, as You have set us apart for Yourself, lead us to set our hearts on You and our feet on the way of Your statutes, to the honor of Your name. Amen.</p>

<p><strong><a class="note-id" href="3025023-3025034" title="Leviticus 25:23-34">25:23&#8211;34</a></strong> Land is God&#8217;s gift to His people through their tribes and clans. God desires that this gift stay in families and never be bargained or sold. God&#8217;s laws of redemption made this possible. At all times, land sold by a poor family member could be redeemed. How greatly the Lord treasures families! In love, God has redeemed us from sin through the precious blood of His Son. We are bought and paid for. We are His. &#8226; Lord, we praise You for sending a Kinsman-Redeemer, Jesus Christ, to redeem us with His precious blood. Amen.</p>

<p><strong><a class="note-id" href="3026014-3026046" title="Leviticus 26:14-46">26:14&#8211;46</a></strong> Failure to obey God&#8217;s statutes, rules, and laws results in punishment. God&#8217;s discipline intensifies as the disobedience intensifies against Him. One by one, God removes His blessings in order to lead His people back to Him in repentance, that He may again shower them with His grace (<a class="bible" href="61003009-61003009" title="2 Peter 3:9">2Pt 3:9</a>). The epitome of God&#8217;s grace is seen at the cross, where His Son died to remove the curse brought by sin (cf <a class="bible" href="62001009-62001009" title="1 John 1:9">1Jn 1:9</a>). &#8226; &#8220;O almighty God, merciful Father, I, a poor, miserable sinner, confess unto You all my sins and iniquities with which I have ever offended You and justly deserved Your temporal and eternal punishment. But I am heartily sorry for them and sincerely repent of them, and I pray You of Your boundless mercy and for the sake of the holy, innocent, bitter sufferings and death of Your beloved Son, Jesus Christ, to be gracious and merciful to me, a poor, sinful being.&#8221; Amen.

<p><strong><a class="note-id" href="3027003-3027031" title="Chapter 27">Ch 27</a></strong> There are four possible reasons for the placement of the laws about vows at the end of Lv. (1) Vows made by the Israelites may be linked to God&#8217;s promises in <a class="bible" href="3000026-3000026" title="chapter 26">ch 26</a>. (2) These laws provide the necessary funding for sanctuary maintenance, allowing the Israelites to keep God&#8217;s command to revere the sanctuary (<a class="bible" href="3026002-3026002" title="Leviticus 26:2">26:2</a>). (3) It allows Lv to end on a positive note, emphasizing Israel&#8217;s voluntary response to God&#8217;s grace. (4) Voluntary contributions to the sanctuary provide a counterbalance to the divinely ordained offerings of <a class="bible" href="3001007-3001007" title="chapters 1-7">chs 1&#8211;7</a>. See &#8220;vow,&#8221; p 7.</p>

The values may be associated with the person&#8217;s productivity. Men of fighting age (cf <a class="bible" href="4001003-4001003" title="Numbers 1:3">Nu 1:3</a>) would pay the most.

<p><strong><a class="note-id" href="3027009-3027091" title="Leviticus 27:9-10">27:9&#8211;10</a></strong> God knows men&#8217;s hearts. The temptation exists to substitute an animal of one species for another, so God prevents such actions by declaring, through His priests, that both animals were holy and not redeemable. Both animals then could be sold and the money used to support the sanctuary.</p>

<p><strong><a class="note-id" href="3027014-3027025" title="Leviticus 27:14-25">27:14&#8211;25</a></strong> Dedicating, or devoting, items in the manner addressed here was often done in answer to prayer. Dedication offerings were different from votive (freewill) offerings. Dedication offerings belonged to God immediately (the offering was consecrated or holy), while votive offerings were made only when God answered a prayer. The most dramatic example of a votive offering is that of Hannah, who volunteered her young son Samuel to God (<a class="bible" href="9001021-9001028" title="1 Samuel 1:21-28">1Sm 1:21&#8211;28</a>). Family land offered to God was redeemable by paying one shekel per year for each area covered by a homer (c 8 bushels) of barley, less the number of years to the next Jubilee, and then adding one-fifth to the total. If an individual had already sold the land pledged to God, the land was forever forfeited to Him.</p>

<p><strong><a class="note-id" href="3027003-3027031" title="Chapter 27">Ch 27</a></strong> Lv concludes by showing how all God&#8217;s people are involved in the stewardship of God&#8217;s house. Based on how God has blessed them, each Israelite provides materials and finances for the maintenance of God&#8217;s sanctuary for the ongoing operation of the Divine Service. The collection of our offerings during the liturgy serves a parallel purpose (cf <a class="bible" href="44004034-44004034,44005011-44005011" title="Acts 4:34-5:11">Ac 4:34&#8211;5:11</a>). Our offerings are part of the holy work of God&#8217;s people for the benefit of the world (<a class="bible" href="45015027-45015027" title="Romans 15:27">Rm 15:27</a>; <a class="bible" href="47009012-47009012" title="2 Corinthians 9:12">2Co 9:12</a>). Through our offerings, we bear witness to what God has done through Calvary&#8217;s cross. &#8226; &#8220;What shall I render to the Lord for all His benefits to me? I will offer the sacrifice of thanksgiving and will call on the name of the Lord. I will take the cup of salvation and will call on the name of the Lord. I will pay my vows to the Lord now in the presence of all His people, in the courts of the Lord&#8217;s house, in the midst of you, O Jerusalem.&#8221; Amen. (<em>LSB</em>, p 176)</p>
