        <p><strong><a class="note-id" href="n01001001-n01002003">1:1&#x2013;2:3</a></strong> God&#x2019;s creation of the world is presented in three stages: declaration of the creation of matter out of nothingness (<a class="bible" href="00001001-00001002" title="Genesis 1:1-2">1:1&#x2013;2</a>); the ordering of creation (days 1 and 2, <a class="bible" href="00001003-00001008" title="Genesis 1:3-8">1:3&#x2013;8</a>); and the filling of creation (days 3 through 6, <a class="bible" href="00001009-00001031" title="Genesis 1:9-31">1:9&#x2013;31</a>). Chem: &#x201C;On the first day He created the earth in order that on the third day He might &#x2026; mould and prepare it for the use of man&#x201D; (<a class="bible" href="00001163-00001163" title="Loci Theologici 1:163">LTh 1:163</a>). God fills creation in two steps: inanimate objects first (days 3 and 4, <a class="bible" href="00001009-00001019" title="Genesis 1:9-19">1:9&#x2013;19</a>), then animate beings (days 5 and 6, <a class="bible" href="00001020-00001031" title="Genesis 1:20-31">1:20&#x2013;31</a>). The account concludes with God&#x2019;s rest on the seventh day (<a class="bible" href="00002001-00002003" title="Genesis 2:1-3">2:1&#x2013;3</a>). The text is written in prose, though several aspects, such as the repetition of the formula &#x201C;God saw that it was good,&#x201D; give the text a heightened rhetorical feel.</p>

        <p><strong><a class="note-id" href="n01001001">1:1</a></strong><em>In the beginning</em>. The <span class="bible-version">esv</span> reflects the traditional translation of the opening phrase, which establishes the point in time at which the action occurs. (Some critical scholars translate the Hbr text similarly to two Babylonian epics, the <em>Enuma Elish</em> and the <em>Epic of Atra-Khasis</em>. Their translation allows denial of the important biblical teaching that God created the world out of nothing [<em>ex nihilo</em>] and argues instead that matter is eternal.) The Bible affirms that God created the world (<a class="bible" href="00090002-00090002" title="Psalms 90:2">Ps 90:2</a>; <a class="bible" href="00010016-00010016" title="Jeremiah 10:16">Jer 10:16</a>) and that He created it out of nothing through Jesus Christ (<a class="bible" href="00004017-00004017" title="Romans 4:17">Rm 4:17</a>; <a class="bible" href="00001002-00001002" title="Hebrews 1:2">Heb 1:2</a>). Ter: &#x201C;By not mentioning [a source of material], [Scripture] has given us a clear proof that there was no such thing&#x201D; (<a class="bible" href="00003489-00003489" title="Ante-Nicene Fathers 3:489">ANF 3:489</a>). <em>created</em>. Hbr <em xml:lang="he">bara&#x2019;</em> is never used with a subject other than God in the OT. God alone has the power to create (bring into existence from nothing). Humans make (or &#x201C;create&#x201D;) things only by rearranging what God has created. That God alone is the Creator of all that exists affirms that He is the only true God. <em>the heavens and the earth</em>. This first &#x201C;couple&#x201D; did not arise by any natural process but came into being as a result of God&#x2019;s direct and unique creative activity. In addition, these terms together refer to the whole of God&#x2019;s creation, the details of which follow. Throughout <a class="bible" href="00000001-00000001" title="chapter 1">ch 1</a>, &#x201C;heavens&#x201D; refers to the sky and the cosmos beyond the boundaries of the earth, not to the abode of God.</p>

        <p><strong><a class="note-id" href="n01001001">1:1</a></strong> God&#x2019;s first act, the creation, is an act of grace. God acts freely to reflect His character, making the world &#x201C;very good&#x201D; (<a class="bible" href="00001031-00001031" title="Genesis 1:31">1:31</a>). Even after the fall and the coming of sin, much of the goodness that God built into creation remains. Philosophers debate why evil exists, and people ask how a good God could allow bad things to happen. But it is not the existence of evil and suffering that requires an explanation; it is the existence of goodness and beauty and love that is most remarkable. A world without God cannot explain such things. The persistence of goodness reminds us of what we have lost, but it also offers us a glimpse of God&#x2019;s grace and the everlasting glory to which God has called us through Christ. &#x2022; &#x201C;Create in me a clean heart, O God, and renew a right spirit within me&#x201D; (<a class="bible" href="00051010-00051010" title="Psalms 51:10">Ps 51:10</a>). Amen.</p>

        <p><strong><a class="note-id" href="n01001002-n01001008">1:2&#x2013;8</a></strong> Describes matter at the first moment of creation (<a class="bible" href="00000002-00000002" title="verse 2">v 2</a>) and then describes how God arranged the matter He created. First, God separated light from darkness (<a class="bible" href="00003005-00003005" title="verses 3-5">vv 3&#x2013;5</a>). Next, God separated what is below the sky from what is above it (<a class="bible" href="00006008-00006008" title="verses 6-8">vv 6&#x2013;8</a>). These arrangements established what we call &#x201C;time&#x201D; (expressed in the sequence of days and nights) and &#x201C;space&#x201D; (expressed in the separation of the waters above and below the sky). This work was the first two days of creation. Scripture does not explicitly state when God made the angels. Ancient rabbinic and Christian interpreters commonly held that angels were created during the first days, though their opinions and reasons varied widely.</p>

        <p><strong>1:2</strong><em>without form and void</em>. God&#x2019;s initial creative act resulted in shapeless matter that God proceeded to arrange, or order, in several stages. <em>the deep</em> &#x2026; <em>the waters</em>. Formlessness is pictured as a watery mixture; neither the sky nor the dry land has been distinguished. Israelites understood water as a formless material. <em>deep</em>. Wordplay: &#x201C;without form&#x201D; (Hbr <em xml:lang="he">tohu</em>) and &#x201C;deep&#x201D; (Hbr <em xml:lang="he">tehom</em>) sound similar. &#x201C;Deep&#x201D; not the everyday term for water or the oceans; suggests the vast inaccessible and formless depths of the seas. Image of the undefined matter of creation as a limitless ocean is suggested by the formlessness of the underwater world, which was unknown, and, therefore, mysterious (cf <a class="bible" href="00038016-00038016" title="Job 38:16">Jb 38:16</a>). Elsewhere, God&#x2019;s power to control the depths of the sea is a sign of His supremacy over both creation (cf <a class="bible" href="00077016-00077016" title="Psalms 77:16">Ps 77:16</a>; <a class="bible" href="00135006-00135006" title="Genesis 135:6">135:6</a>) and other gods (see parting of the Red Sea in <a class="bible" href="00015005-00015005,00015008-00015008" title="Exodus 15:5; Exodus 15:8">Ex 15:5, 8</a>; cf <a class="bible" href="00106009-00106009" title="Psalms 106:9">Ps 106:9</a>; <a class="bible" href="00051010-00051010" title="Isaiah 51:10">Is 51:10</a>; <a class="bible" href="00063013-00063013" title="Isaiah 63:13">63:13</a>). See note, <a class="bible" href="00004039-00004039" title="Mark 4:39">Mk 4:39</a>. <em>the Spirit of God</em>. God&#x2019;s active presence in creation. <em>hovering</em>. The Spirit&#x2019;s activity is pictured as a bird or butterfly fluttering over the waters. Bas: &#x201C;By the Spirit of God, he means the Holy Spirit&#x201D; (<a class="bible" href="00008062-00008062" title="Library of Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers of the Christian Church, Series 2 8:62">NPNF2 8:62</a>). Mel: &#x201C;The Father, by speaking, begets the Word who is the image of the eternal Father. And of the Holy Spirit it is expressly said, &#x2018;And the Spirit &#x2026;&#x2019; &#x201D; (Chem, <a class="bible" href="00001050-00001050" title="Loci Theologici 1:50">LTh 1:50</a>). God was directly involved in not only the action of creating (bringing into existence out of nothing) but also in the work of bringing form and order to that which He had created. There is no place in the biblical view of creation for the abstract and impersonal process of evolution. The Bible affirms that the Father directly and intentionally called the order of the cosmos into being through the Son (<a class="bible" href="00008022-00008036" title="Proverbs 8:22-36">Pr 8:22&#x2013;36</a>; <a class="bible" href="00001003-00001003" title="John 1:3">Jn 1:3</a>; <a class="bible" href="00001002-00001002" title="Hebrews 1:2">Heb 1:2</a>).</p>

        <p><strong>1:3</strong><em>And God said</em>. Note well: In pagan religions of the ancient Near East, nature and the realm of the gods were blended together; material things, such as the sun and moon, or trees and stones, were thought to be divine. (In the Babylonian <em>Epic of Atra-Khasis</em>, the material world was formed when the gods mixed the blood of a slain god with dirt. In the <em>Enuma Elish</em>, the material world was formed out of the body parts of a slain goddess. By these literary devices, ancient mythology communicated the idea that matter itself was formed of the essence of divinity.) In contrast, the Bible makes clear that God is distinct from the material world. The cosmos is not divine, made up of elements of the gods. Rather, the one true God called the cosmos into being out of nothingness and arranged it by the power of His Word alone. God&#x2019;s Word is &#x201C;performative&#x201D;&#x2014;it does not merely state something, but it accomplishes, or brings about, that which it declares. See notes, <a class="bible" href="00010017-00010017" title="Romans 10:17">Rm 10:17</a>; <a class="bible" href="00055011-00055011" title="Isaiah 55:11">Is 55:11</a>. <em>light</em>. Not natural sunlight, but light called into being by God&#x2019;s Word to contrast the unbroken darkness that was the setting for God&#x2019;s initial creative act (<a class="bible" href="00000002-00000002" title="verse 2">v 2</a>). This anticipates the restored creation at the end of time, in which God&#x2019;s presence will enlighten all things, and there will no longer be a need for the sun or the moon (<a class="bible" href="00021023-00021023" title="Revelation 21:23">Rv 21:23</a>; <a class="bible" href="00022005-00022005" title="Revelation 22:5">22:5</a>). Jesus embodied the light of God&#x2019;s presence (<a class="bible" href="00008012-00008012" title="John 8:12">Jn 8:12</a>), and God shines this light in us to create faith in Him. For these reasons, lights (lamps or candles) are used in Christian worship to symbolize God&#x2019;s active faith-creating and faith-sustaining presence among His people. See &#x201C;seven,&#x201D; p 217.</p>

        <p><strong>1:4</strong><em>good</em>. God judged that this first step in ordering His creation conformed to His will.

        <p><strong>1:5</strong><em>God called</em>. Hbr idiom used to assign a name. Lit, &#x201C;God called to the light: day.&#x201D; Though God allowed Adam to name the living things with which He filled creation (<a class="bible" href="00002019-00002020" title="Genesis 2:19-20">2:19&#x2013;20</a>), God Himself assigned names to the fundamental distinctions He made as He ordered His creation. <em>the first day</em>. Lit, &#x201C;day 1.&#x201D; The first cycle of time, initiated by the distinction of light from darkness. <em>first</em>. Lit, &#x201C;one.&#x201D; Moses used the cardinal number here instead of the ordinal form &#x201C;first&#x201D;; his time-related words make it quite clear that we are to understand this day 1 as a normal 24-hour day, bounded by an evening and a morning. See note, <a class="bible" href="00023032-00023032" title="Leviticus 23:32">Lv 23:32</a>. With the six days to follow, it makes up a single week. See note, <a class="bible" href="00000014-00000014" title="verse 14">v 14</a>. <em>day</em>. Hbr <em xml:lang="he">yom</em>; not always used to designate a 24-hour day (e.g., refers to only the daylight portion of a 24-hour day in <a class="bible" href="00000005-00000005,00000016-00000016" title="verses 5; verses 16">vv 5, 16</a>), but that is by far its most basic use.</p>

        <p><strong>1:6</strong> God&#x2019;s ordering activity changes. See note, <a class="bible" href="00002008-00002008" title="verses 2-8">vv 2&#x2013;8</a>. God introduced three fundamental distinctions in the physical world, as the Israelites understood it: sky, sea, and dry land. <em>expanse</em>. Difficult term. Hbr <em xml:lang="he">raqia&#x2018;</em>, translated &#x201C;Heaven&#x201D; in <a class="bible" href="00000008-00000008" title="verse 8">v 8</a>, suggests a metal plate made flat through hammering. The point of the image is the function rather than the substance: the sky serves as a divider. The Israelites often used figurative terms to describe the cosmos as it appeared to them (cf <a class="bible" href="00040022-00040022" title="Isaiah 40:22">Is 40:22</a>, where the sky is described as a &#x201C;curtain&#x201D; and a &#x201C;tent&#x201D;). <em>let it separate the waters from the waters</em>. The expanse separates the waters that are above from the waters that are below (<a class="bible" href="00000007-00000007" title="verse 7">v 7</a>). This was the first step in organizing the spatial aspect of creation.</p>

        <p><strong>1:7</strong><em>God</em> &#x2026; <em>separated the waters</em>. World is described in terms of human experience. To the Israelites, a blue sky and falling rain indicated that there was water above the layer of the air. The seas and the water that emerges from the ground in springs and wells indicated that there was water below (cf <a class="bible" href="00024002-00024002" title="Psalms 24:2">Ps 24:2</a>).

This is a general distinction, not an attempt to establish a complete scientific categorization of plants. <em>according to its kind</em>. Phrase here and in following passages indicates that <a class="bible" href="00000001-00000001" title="chapter 1">ch 1</a> talks not only about creation of specific individuals but of classes (or kinds) of things.

        <p><strong>1:14</strong><em>Let there be lights</em>. Sources of light above the expanse. Just as God gathered the waters into a consolidated place (the sea), God joined the light that He had previously created (<a class="bible" href="00003005-00003005" title="verses 3-5">vv 3&#x2013;5</a>) to natural sources. These sources of light will now govern the cycles of time that He established until they are no longer needed at the end of time (see note, <a class="bible" href="00000003-00000003" title="verse 3">v 3</a>). <em>signs</em>. Movement of stars helps us keep track of months, seasons, and years. Stars do not control humankind&#x2019;s destiny or predict the future. <em>days</em>. Hbr plural for &#x201C;day,&#x201D; but in the context it appears to refer to what we call a month (not otherwise mentioned here). It is unlikely that &#x201C;days&#x201D; here refers to a week because that period of time is not indicated by the movement of the sun, moon, or stars, but comes into being when God establishes every seventh day as a day of rest (<a class="bible" href="00002001-00002003" title="confer 2:1-3">cf 2:1&#x2013;3</a>). To sustain the argument that day 1 does not refer to a normal 24-hour day, one would have to show that all these other time-related terms are being used in some figurative, or extended, sense. This is not the case. Here the sun, moon, and stars govern normal days, nights, months, seasons, and years. See note, <a class="bible" href="00000005-00000005" title="verse 5">v 5</a>.</p>

        <p><strong>1:26</strong><em>Let Us make</em>. While affirming the singularity of God, it is not unusual for the OT to use the plural when speaking of God and His activities. This anticipates the doctrine of the Holy Trinity (though some interpreters understand it to be a grammatical device, a plural of majesty or an honorific plural, with no specific theological significance). Iren: &#x201C;With Him were always present the Word and Wisdom, the Son and the Spirit, by whom and in whom, freely and spontaneously, He made all things, to whom also He speaks&#x201D; (<a class="bible" href="00001487-00001488" title="Ante-Nicene Fathers 1:487-88">ANF 1:487&#x2013;88</a>). Ter: &#x201C;If the number of the Trinity also offends you, &#x2026; with whom did He make man? and to whom did He make him like? (The answer must be), the Son on the one hand, who was one day to put on human nature; and the Spirit on the other, who was to sanctify man. With these did He then speak, in the Unity of the Trinity, as with His ministers and witnesses&#x201D; ( <a class="bible" href="00003606-00003607" title="Ante-Nicene Fathers 3:606-7">ANF 3:606&#x2013;7</a>). Luth: &#x201C;Here both appear: &#x2018;Let Us make&#x2019; and &#x2018;He made,&#x2019; in the plural and in the singular; thereby Moses clearly and forcibly shows us that within and in the very Godhead and the Creating Essence there is one inseparable and eternal plurality&#x201D; (<a class="bible" href="00001058-00001058" title="American Edition 1:58">AE 1:58</a>). <em>image</em>. Hbr <em xml:lang="he">tselem</em> means something more than mere physical resemblance. An image, in ancient Near Eastern thought, was that which manifested the presence of the gods within the material realm. Created in God&#x2019;s image, Adam not only reflected God&#x2019;s character but also was His representative in the world, His steward over all that He had made. &#x201C;They had God&#x2019;s Law written into their hearts, because they were created in God&#x2019;s image&#x201D; (FC <a class="bible" href="00000002-00000002" title="Epitome VI 2">Ep VI 2</a>). Gr Nys: &#x201C;Painters transfer human forms to their pictures by the means of certain colors &#x2026; our Maker also, painting the portrait to resemble His own beauty, by the addition of virtues, as it were with colors, shows in us His own sovereignty: &#x2026; purity, freedom from passion, blessedness, alienation from all evil, and all those attributes of the like kind which help to form in men the likeness of God&#x201D; ( <a class="bible" href="00539001-00539001" title="Library of Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers of the Christian Church, Series 2 539:1">NPNF2 5:391</a>). Gr Naz: &#x201C;[God] will reason with us, and oppose us, and set before us those bitter accusers, our sins &#x2026; the image [of God in us] &#x2026; has been blurred and spoiled by wickedness&#x201D; ( <a class="bible" href="00007250-00007250" title="Library of Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers of the Christian Church, Series 2 7:250">NPNF2 7:250</a>). <em>have dominion</em>. To rule over something. The order that God imposed upon His creation extends to the beings with which He filled it, whether in the air or in the sea or on land. As God&#x2019;s steward and representative, Adam is placed over all that God has made, to rule over it as God Himself would rule it. Luth: &#x201C;Man is a creature far superior to the rest of the living beings that live a physical life, especially since as yet his nature had not become depraved&#x201D; (<a class="bible" href="00001056-00001056" title="American Edition 1:56">AE 1:56</a>).</p>

Unlike the other cycles of time mentioned in the creation account, the cycle of a week (bounded by the day of rest) is determined not by the movement of the heavenly bodies but is established only by God&#x2019;s special command.

        <p><strong>2:1&#x2013;3</strong> God creates (sets aside) the Sabbath. In the OT, Saturday is the Rest (Sabbath) Day. When Christ fulfilled the whole Law (<a class="bible" href="00005017-00005017" title="Matthew 5:17">Mt 5:17</a>), He liberated God&#x2019;s people from the obligation to observe the Sabbath given to the people of Israel in the OT (<a class="bible" href="00002016-00002017" title="Colossians 2:16-17">Col 2:16&#x2013;17</a>). All days belong equally to God (<a class="bible" href="00014005-00014006" title="Romans 14:5-6">Rm 14:5&#x2013;6</a>). Nevertheless, faith in Christ moves God&#x2019;s people to respond to His grace in worship: to hear His Word, to receive His gifts in the Sacraments, to praise Him and give thanks to Him for His mighty works, and to call on Him in prayer. Such worship is the constant response of faith to God&#x2019;s grace. Because God has called Christians together into one Body, the Church, through which He gives His gifts of Word and Sacrament, it is proper for Christians to gather together to worship Him. See note, <a class="bible" href="00016002-00016002" title="1 Corinthians 16:2">1Co 16:2</a>. Sunday, then, symbolically represents the first day of the new rest into which God&#x2019;s people have been called in Christ. (As the first day of this &#x201C;new creation,&#x201D; Sunday is sometimes referred to as &#x201C;the eighth day.&#x201D;) &#x2022; We praise You, O Lord, for the day of rest that our bodies need.

The Bible views a person as a whole being&#x2014;physical and spiritual together&#x2014;and not as a soul inhabiting a body, a concept borrowed from Greek philosophy. (For this reason, throughout the Bible spiritual and physical health are seen as belonging together, so that physical impairment may be interpreted as a sign of sin, and healing as a sign of forgiveness [<a class="bible" href="00009005-00009005" title="Matthew 9:5">Mt 9:5</a>]. For this reason also, St Paul speaks of the danger of taking the Lord&#x2019;s Supper without recognizing it as Christ&#x2019;s true body and blood in physical terms [<a class="bible" href="00011027-00011030" title="1 Corinthians 11:27-30">1Co 11:27&#x2013;30</a>].)

        <p><strong><a class="note-id" href="n01003001">3:1</a></strong><em>serpent</em>. Common Hbr word for &#x201C;snake.&#x201D; Snakes would have been among either the general group of &#x201C;creeping things&#x201D; or among the &#x201C;beasts of the earth&#x201D; (<a class="bible" href="00001024-00001024" title="Genesis 1:24">1:24</a>) that God created. There is nothing inherently evil in snakes. In this instance, Satan has either possessed one of these animals or appeared in their form. <em>crafty</em>. In Pr, this word is used with a positive connotation (&#x201C;prudent,&#x201D; <a class="bible" href="00012016-00012016,00012023-00012023" title="Proverbs 12:16; Proverbs 12:23">Pr 12:16, 23</a>; <a class="bible" href="00013016-00013016" title="Proverbs 13:16">13:16</a>; <a class="bible" href="00014008-00014008,00014015-00014015,00014018-00014018" title="Proverbs 14:8; Proverbs 14:15; Proverbs 14:18">14:8, 15, 18</a>; <a class="bible" href="00022003-00022003" title="Proverbs 22:3">22:3</a>; <a class="bible" href="00027012-00027012" title="Proverbs 27:12">27:12</a>). In Jb, it is used with a negative connotation (&#x201C;crafty,&#x201D; <a class="bible" href="00005012-00005012" title="Job 5:12">Jb 5:12</a>; <a class="bible" href="00015005-00015005" title="Job 15:5">15:5</a>). Here in Gn, the usage appears to be neutral. The main reason for the choice of this word (<em>&#x2018;arum</em>) appears to be that it forms a play on words with the word &#x201C;naked&#x201D; (<em>&#x2018;arom</em>) in <a class="bible" href="00002025-00002025" title="Genesis 2:25">2:25</a>. <em>Did God actually say</em>. First temptation was (and remains) the temptation to doubt God&#x2019;s Word. Satan implies God has selfish motives, but there is no hint from Moses that God had ill motives toward Adam and Eve or planned their fall. Moses makes clear that the destructive effects of sin only grieved God (<a class="bible" href="00006006-00006006" title="Genesis 6:6">6:6</a>). &#x201C;[The devil] turned Adam and Eve into enthusiasts. He led them away from God&#x2019;s outward Word to spiritualizing and self-pride&#x201D; (<a class="bible" href="00000005-00000005" title="Smalcald Articles III VIII 5">SA III VIII 5</a>).

        <p><strong><a class="note-id" href="n01003005">3:5</a></strong><em>God knows</em>. The serpent does not challenge the woman&#x2019;s understanding of God&#x2019;s instructions, but calls God&#x2019;s integrity into doubt, suggesting that the real reason God does not want them to eat of the fruit is that He wants to keep them from becoming like Him. <em>you will be like God</em>. Note the progress of temptation: having begun with doubt about God&#x2019;s Word, he then moved to rejection of it, and now the serpent offers Eve the power to establish her own standard of right and wrong, to define truth for herself. The temptation to which the serpent exposed the woman, and to which all humankind has been subject since the first disobedience, is the desire to become godlike, the desire to determine our own standards of good and evil and to direct our own affairs according to our will. <em>knowing good and evil</em>. God does know evil, not because it is part of His character, but in the sense that He understands the destructive nature of evil. So far, man and woman had known only the good of God&#x2019;s very good creation. In view of this, the serpent spoke the truth: by disobeying God they will come to know evil as well as good. For the man and the woman, however, the only way to come to know evil is by doing evil through the breaking of God&#x2019;s command.</p>

In her desire to gain wisdom, the woman lost sight of the fundamental truth about wisdom: to be truly wise is to believe and trust in God and to obey His teachings. This truth is summarized in the OT saying that the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom (see note, <a class="bible" href="00001007-00001007" title="Proverbs 1:7">Pr 1:7</a>; see also p 1001).

The immediate result of their disobedience was a new experience of self-consciousness that resulted from the breaking of the union that formerly characterized their relationship with each other and with God. This feeling of separateness produced a shame that had not been a part of their experience (<a class="bible" href="00002025-00002025" title="Genesis 2:25">2:25</a>). Luth: &#x201C;It is as if [Moses] were saying: &#x2018;Satan had closed not only the eyes but also the heart of Eve through the unbelief and disobedience of all her members within and without. But after sin was allowed to enter and was committed, he blithely allows their eyes to be opened that they may see what they had done.&#x2019; Here Satan seeks to make another gain, namely, that those who have sinned should perish in despair&#x201D; (<a class="bible" href="00001164-00001164" title="American Edition 1:164">AE 1:164</a>).</p>

        <p><strong><a class="note-id" href="n01003015">3:15</a></strong> Note movement in the text, which begins with conflict between the woman and the serpent. It then moves to conflict between the descendant of the woman and the descendant of the serpent. But, unusually, it concludes with conflict between the woman&#x2019;s descendant and the serpent himself. Clearly this verse is not simply about the origin of the conflict between humans and snakes, but about a conflict that will culminate with the defeat of the serpent by One who will descend from the woman. This points to Christ and His defeat of Satan on the cross, and for this reason this verse is often called the &#x201C;protevangelium&#x201D; (the first promise of the Gospel). <em>her offspring</em>. Hbr zera&#x2018;, &#x201C;seed&#x201D; (singular form can refer to one seed or to an entire group; e.g., Eng, &#x201C;bag of seed,&#x201D; not &#x201C;bag of seeds&#x201D;). It refers to all the descendants of Eve, but most significantly to Christ as the Second Adam, i.e., all humanity reduced to one. <em>He</em>. Presence of other masculine grammatical forms makes it clear that Hbr intends the subject to be masculine, not feminine. Vulg inaccurately translates this as a feminine form (she), leading some to interpret this as referring to the Virgin Mary. <em>bruise</em>. Some commentators argue that the two forms of the verb used of the actions of the seed and the serpent are actually from two different Hbr words (e.g., <em>crush &#x2026; strike</em> in NIV). While there is some support for this among languages related to Hbr, most scholars prefer to take these two forms as being from the same Hbr word. The difference in the degree of injury inflicted does not depend on having two different verbs here but on the differing parts of the body being struck. Luth: &#x201C;Satan understood this threat well; therefore he has continued to rage against human nature with such great hatred. Adam and Eve were encouraged by this promise. Wholeheartedly they grasped the hope of their restoration; and, full of faith, they saw that God cared about their salvation, since He clearly declares that the male Seed of the woman would prostrate this enemy&#x201D; (<a class="bible" href="00001193-00001193" title="American Edition 1:193">AE 1:193</a>).

        <p><strong><a class="note-id" href="n01003021">3:21</a></strong> Some commentators argue that God killed animals to provide a covering for Adam and Eve, thus anticipating the introduction of the sacrificial system (as providing a covering for sins), and so ultimately pointing to Christ. However, nothing in this verse necessarily implies that God killed the animals whose skins were used; they could have died of natural causes after the fall. Moreover, this verse is never treated as messianic elsewhere in the Bible. While it may be read by Christians as an allegory pointing to Christ, it is probably more accurate in this context to suggest that the verse demonstrates God&#x2019;s continuing care for Adam and Eve (and ultimately for all creation) despite the judgment that He had pronounced on them. Luth: &#x201C;Here Adam and Eve are dressed in garments by the Lord God Himself. Whenever they looked at their garments, these were to serve as a reminder to them to give thought to their wretched fall from supreme happiness into the utmost misfortune and trouble. Thus they were to be constantly afraid of sinning, to repent continually, and to sigh for the forgiveness of sins through the promised Seed. This is also why He clothed them, not in foliage or in cotton but in the skins of slain animals, for a sign that they are mortal and that they are living in certain death&#x201D; (<a class="bible" href="00001221-00001221" title="American Edition 1:221">AE 1:221</a>).</p>

Some interpreters, including Luther (<a class="bible" href="00001242-00001242" title="American Edition 1:242">AE 1:242</a>), understand Hbr to mean that Eve thought Cain was the Lord incarnate, the fulfillment of the promise of the seed in <a class="bible" href="00003015-00003015" title="Genesis 3:15">3:15</a>.

Abel&#x2019;s offering was not inherently superior to Cain&#x2019;s offering. Both were proper thank offerings. Throughout the OT, God looks with favor on offerings of grain and other produce, just as He does on offerings of animals. See pp 170&#x2013;71.

Just as Adam was expelled from God&#x2019;s presence when he was forced out of the Garden of Eden, so Cain interprets his being forced off the land as an expulsion from God&#x2019;s presence.

They are not mentioned in this account because they are not important to the story of Cain killing his brother. The Bible does not attempt to give us a complete, detailed history of everything, but focuses on events most important to its theological purpose. See note, <a class="bible" href="00000017-00000017" title="verse 17">v 17</a>. <em>will kill me</em>. Following the biblical principle that the punishment should fit the crime, Cain expects that God&#x2019;s judgment against him for killing his brother will eventually lead to his own death.</p>

Different interpretations of Hbr are possible. Likely, Enoch built the city and named it after his son Irad. It is the first city mentioned in the Bible. That it is built by a descendant of Cain, who was no longer able to earn a living by tilling the soil, is appropriate. The term &#x201C;city&#x201D; may be misleading to modern readers.

Lamech intimidates his wives by bragging of his violence, which exceeds both the accepted social norms of justice and Cain&#x2019;s sinful vengeance inflicted on his brother. The fact that Lamech stands at the end of Cain&#x2019;s genealogy and that he exceeds Cain&#x2019;s violence by multiples of the number seven suggest the logical outcome of Cain&#x2019;s violence. Thus, in both his polygamy and his violence, Lamech personifies the descent into sin that leads ultimately to the flood (<a class="bible" href="00006005-00006008" title="Genesis 6:5-8">6:5&#x2013;8</a>).

        <p><strong><a class="note-id" href="n01000004">Ch 4</a></strong><a class="bible" href="00000004-00000004" title="Genesis 4">Gn 4</a> begins with a murder and traces how the shadow of violence lengthens until Lamech perverts God&#x2019;s intention for marriage by taking two wives and boasting that he is 77 times more violent than his murderous ancestor Cain. But we also learn of the birth of Seth, through whom God&#x2019;s promise (<a class="bible" href="00003015-00003015" title="Genesis 3:15">3:15</a>) will continue. God&#x2019;s plan is not stopped by murder. God appoints another seed of the woman to receive the promise and to carry the story forward. The promise continues to unfold until it comes at last to the cross. There, Satan tries to derail God&#x2019;s plan by killing the seed of the woman. Once again, God prevails, not by appointing another, but by raising Jesus from the dead in declaration that the work is finished, creation is redeemed, and death itself&#x2014;the chief effect of the fall&#x2014;is put to death. &#x2022; Derail for me, O Lord, the devil&#x2019;s evil plans. Grant me Your help and salvation in Christ. Amen.</p>

In this instance, God took Enoch into heaven. The uniqueness of this event inspired considerable interest in Enoch in later generations. During the intertestamental period, some writers used Enoch as a character in a number of speculative works, which they pretended he had written. These were eventually collected into a work known today as 1 Enoch (see note, <a class="bible" href="00014015-00014015" title="Jude 14-15">Jude 14&#x2013;15</a>).

Hbr text departs from the formula used throughout <a class="bible" href="00000005-00000005" title="chapter 5">ch 5</a> (&#x201C;when X had lived Y years&#x201D;). Apparently Moses wanted to mention all three sons because all are important to the account that follows. The change of formula has led some to suggest that Shem, Ham, and Japheth were triplets. Though possible, such an interpretation is not specifically indicated or required. Noah may have had other children in the first 500 years of his life who are not mentioned in this account because they are no longer living with Noah and are not part of the household who go with him into the ark. The Bible regularly omits historical details that are not significant to the unfolding story. See note, <a class="bible" href="00004014-00004014" title="Genesis 4:14">4:14</a>.</p>

        <p><strong><a class="note-id" href="n01000005">Ch 5</a></strong> The genealogical summary advances the story to the next major development&#x2014;the flood. Genealogies teach an important theological lesson: God perseveres in the fulfillment of His promises. God does not become bored with His plan or discouraged by Satan&#x2019;s efforts to derail it. Like God&#x2019;s people before us, we often wander from God&#x2019;s path. Yet, God works patiently to set the course right again and to draw us back to Himself. For this reason, the genealogies that may seem boring actually proclaim &#x201C;The Lord is not slow to fulfill His promise as some count slowness, but is patient toward you, not wishing that any should perish, but that all should reach repentance&#x201D; (<a class="bible" href="00003009-00003009" title="2 Peter 3:9">2Pt 3:9</a>). &#x2022; Lord, fulfill Your good purpose for me in Christ, as You have promised.

His name is Isaac, &#x201C;he laughs,&#x201D; calling to mind the past laughter of his parents and describing their joy upon his birth. The parents needed patience and faith as those 25 years came and went. How impatient we can become when things do not go as we think they should, even over short periods of time, even when God has clearly promised that all things will work together for good. But God is faithful, even when our patience and faith fall short. He has delivered the greatest of His promises, to give salvation and everlasting life to all who believe in the Lord Jesus. &#x2022;Heavenly Father, keep us patient and faithful while You carry out Your plan for our lives and our salvation.

        <p><strong><a class="note-id" href="n01000023">Ch 23</a></strong> Sarah&#x2019;s death is the occasion for a significant development: Abraham purchases a plot of ground in the Promised Land, a testimony to his confidence in God&#x2019;s promises and to his concern for his wife&#x2019;s remains. At times of death, it is important to give clear testimony to our faith in God&#x2019;s promises, even as God Himself did. God&#x2019;s testimony at the time of His Son&#x2019;s death was clear. By raising Him from the dead on the third day, He assured bodily resurrection and eternal life in heaven for all who believe in Him. &#x2022; O Lord, grant us confidence in Your promises like that of Abraham, a confidence that is reflected in all we do.

Our hope cannot rest on human nature or accomplishments. We share in this fallen humanity and often act like these biblical figures. Despite this sorry state, Christ became our substitute. He loved us and gave Himself up for us, a fragrant offering and sacrifice to God. He was cursed so we may be blessed (<a class="bible" href="00003013-00003013" title="Galatians 3:13">Gal 3:13</a>). Through the means of grace (Gospel and Sacraments), we receive the blessings of Christ&#x2019;s saving acts. &#x2022; Lord, we thank You for providing a salvation that does not rely on our virtue or accomplishments.

        <p><strong><a class="note-id" href="n01028001-n01028005">28:1&#x2013;5</a></strong> Isaac gives Jacob a command and a blessing: Jacob must leave home, go to his relatives, and not marry a Canaanite wife. Before he departs, Isaac gives Jacob the blessing of Abraham, a blessing that includes the land of Canaan, many descendants, and ultimately the dignity of being an ancestor of the Messiah. Parents today should carefully raise their children to seek a godly, Christian spouse, and children should honor and obey their parents according to God&#x2019;s Word. This is God&#x2019;s command. But He also has a blessing for us. In Christ Jesus, the blessing of Abraham comes to all nations, so that we might receive the promised Spirit through faith (<a class="bible" href="00003014-00003014" title="Galatians 3:14">Gal 3:14</a>). &#x2022; Heavenly Father, keep us in Your Son, Jesus, that we may retain the Holy Spirit to the end of our days.

An elongated stone set in the ground like a short pillar, for cultural or religious purposes. The raising of such stones is ancient. They appear much like grave markers with rounded tops. At Canaanite temple sites, the stones could represent worshipers or gods, whose images are carved on the faces of some stones. Such stones could also serve as markers (<a class="bible" href="00031052-00031052" title="confer 31:52">cf 31:52</a>; <a class="bible" href="00035020-00035020" title="confer 35:20">35:20</a>). Jacob used the pillar in this way, to mark the spot where God appeared to him. He would later build an altar from this stone and others, and he would preach God&#x2019;s name and sacrifice at this altar (<a class="bible" href="00000022-00000022" title="verse 22">v 22</a>).

        <p><strong><a class="note-id" href="n01035016-n01035029">35:16&#x2013;29</a></strong> Sorrows surround Jacob. He learns of his son&#x2019;s incest with his concubine and also the death of his wife and of his father. God-fearing people such as Jacob sometimes have children who fall into great sin and shame. And even those who receive God&#x2019;s promises, such as Rachel and Isaac, are still subject to death. Mourning is a part of life in a sin-broken world. When sorrows surround you, call on the Lord in prayer. Remember and celebrate His promises, which are guaranteed to you in Jesus&#x2019; death and resurrection. Because Jesus conquered death and sin, we have comfort in the midst of all troubles. &#x2022; O Lord, forgive our sins, and bring us to eternal life for Jesus&#x2019; sake. Amen.</p>

        <p><strong><a class="note-id" href="n01037012-n01037036">37:12&#x2013;36</a></strong> Joseph is betrayed by his brothers and sold into slavery. Yet God spares Joseph&#x2019;s life in order to fulfill His plan and the dreams He had revealed. When sin is not dealt with, it breeds even more wickedness. Joseph&#x2019;s brothers let their hatred lead to betrayal and lies. Many years later, God&#x2019;s Son was betrayed by His friend, not for 20 shekels but for 30 pieces of silver. Yet this also took place so that God could fulfill His plan for our salvation. &#x2022; Heavenly Father, enable us to help those in need. Turn us away from self-pity and worry to compassion and sympathy. Send Your Holy Spirit to strengthen our faith in times of trial. In the Savior&#x2019;s name we pray. Amen.</p>

        <p><strong><a class="note-id" href="n01039001">Ch 38</a></strong> The sins of Onan, Judah, and Tamar make this one of the most sordid chapters of the Bible. Yet despite human sinfulness, God is at work. Through Judah&#x2019;s son Perez, the line that would eventually give birth to the Savior was preserved (cf <a class="bible" href="00001003-00001003" title="Matthew 1:3">Mt 1:3</a>). Sexual sins lead to trouble and heartache in this life. Yet God does not cast away those who were conceived and born out of wedlock, but He preserves those who fear Him, just as He preserved Perez. So let us flee from sexual immorality, being mindful that God punishes unchastity. And let us confess our sins as Judah did, knowing that God, for the sake of Jesus Christ, will forgive all who repent. &#x2022; Holy God, forgive us our sins. Fill our hearts with the sober and chaste love of Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>

Having failed to break Joseph&#x2019;s faith in 10 years of trials, the devil now comes from a new angle, tempting Joseph with lust and pleasure. Luth: &#x201C;Through the working of the Holy Spirit [Joseph] listened to and retained the teaching of his father with the greatest faithfulness and diligence. Accordingly, there shines in him the most ardent faith when in his early, blooming youth he is assailed not only by the worst misfortunes but also by the greatest allurements of pleasure. Yet he cannot be subdued or overcome. Young people should set this example before themselves&#x201D; (<a class="bible" href="00007054-00007054" title="American Edition 7:54">AE 7:54</a>).</p>

To affect all Egypt, the drought would have included the Upper Nile, minimizing yearly floods downstream.

As the years of famine begin to take their toll, there is enough surplus to share with those in need throughout all the earth. In hard times, those who have should share with those who have not. Here is comfort: after long periods of suffering, at just the right time, the Lord will give help to His people, just as He did for Joseph. Through His Son, Jesus, God rules over us and gives us what we need: pardon, provision, and peace. &#x2022; Heavenly Father, give us this day our daily bread, and deliver us from evil, for Jesus&#x2019; sake.

        <p><strong><a class="note-id" href="n01044001">Ch 43</a></strong> Joseph&#x2014;motivated by love for Benjamin and his other brothers&#x2014;tests his brothers to learn whether they will be jealous or abandon their youngest brother, as they had Joseph. Joseph&#x2019;s conduct is like God&#x2019;s. He displays both generosity and severity, seeking repentance. The brothers&#x2019; fear comes from the alienating power of sin. When we do not rightly fear God, we fear other things more (<a class="bible" href="00010028-00010028" title="Matthew 10:28">Mt 10:28</a>). Joseph&#x2019;s banquet displays kindness and generosity, independent of his brothers&#x2019; recognition of his love. So also God blesses His people, even when they doubt His goodness. Jesus, like His earthly ancestor, Judah, offered Himself to His Father for us. &#x2022; Holy God, give us grace to endure Your tests and to recognize Your kindness, in Jesus&#x2019; name. Amen.</p>

        <p><strong><a class="note-id" href="n01045001">Ch 44</a></strong> Joseph prepares a final test to determine whether his brothers will allow Benjamin to be enslaved and bring further grief to their father. Their refusal to leave Benjamin behind, and Judah&#x2019;s sacrificial offer of himself to spare both brother and father, show that their hearts have genuinely changed. Like Joseph, God often tests what is in our hearts. He reminds us to humbly acknowledge and take responsibility for our sin. When Judah mediates with his father and with Joseph, and shows himself willing to be enslaved in place of his brother, this prefigures the saving work of his descendant, Jesus, who gave Himself as mediator, ransom, and sacrifice for the world. &#x2022; Jesus, You gave Yourself for us and made known the Father&#x2019;s loving heart.

        <p><strong><a class="note-id" href="n01048003">Ch 47</a></strong> Powerful, wealthy Pharaoh humbly receives the blessing of Jacob, a lowly Hebrew, whose son addresses the famine by centralizing all Egypt&#x2019;s resources in a sharecropping system. Like Pharaoh, we should realize that spiritual blessings take precedence over temporal ones. People who put earthly security and temporal blessings first often take desperate measures to keep things that death will someday take from them. Just as blessing came to mighty Pharaoh through a lowly shepherd, so also the kingdom of God and His righteousness come to believers in humble forms&#x2014;an infant in a manger, a man dying on a cross; words, water, bread, wine&#x2014;yet in them are hidden God&#x2019;s majesty. &#x2022; &#x201C;Be present at our table, Lord; Be here and ev&#x2019;rywhere adored; Thy creatures bless, and grant that we May feast in paradise with Thee.&#x201D; Amen.

To console despairing sinners, God causes the Gospel of reconciliation in Christ to be preached, and He confirms this message with the comforting Sacraments of Baptism and the Holy Supper. &#x2022; O Lord, though humans meant to do evil to You with the cross, You meant it for good, to bring about eternal salvation. Praise to You, O Christ. Amen.</p>

        <p><strong><a class="note-id" href="n00000000">50:22&#x2013;26</a></strong> The death of Joseph after 93 years in Egypt closes the first Book of Moses, but his request for final burial in Canaan reminds us that the story has only begun. Joseph&#x2019;s life illustrates one of God&#x2019;s promises for obedience to the Law&#x2014;prosperous, long life (<a class="bible" href="00020012-00020012" title="Exodus 20:12">Ex 20:12</a>). Despite his long, prosperous life, Joseph looks forward, not back: &#x201C;God <em>will</em> surely visit you&#x201D; (<a class="bible" href="00000025-00000025" title="verse 25">v 25</a>). Egypt&#x2019;s material prosperity is not God&#x2019;s ultimate blessing for His people. The coming gift is the Lord Himself, His visitation, fulfilled in part in the exodus from Egypt. But even the exodus pales before God&#x2019;s final visitation in the Messiah (<a class="bible" href="00001068-00001068" title="Luke 1:68">Lk 1:68</a>) and its culmination when the bones of Joseph and all the redeemed are raised to immortality (<a class="bible" href="00015053-00015057" title="1 Corinthians 15:53-57">1Co 15:53&#x2013;57</a>). &#x2022; &#x201C;Give ear, O Shepherd of Israel, You who lead Joseph like a flock!&#x201D; (<a class="bible" href="00080001-00080001" title="Psalms 80:1">Ps 80:1</a>). Give us hearts that long for Your return to lead us out of the Egypt of this world to Yourself in heaven. Amen.</p>
